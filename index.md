The impact and culture of Facebook has proven to be destructive not only of individuals, but also of the world itself

I think of how I was so cautious about Emma's fascination with the app back in the "oughts" when she was an early teenager.

## History

### Thomas Cromwell reinterpreted

[[2025-03-28]]

[Rags-to-riches hero or villainous torturer? The truth about Henry VIII's scheming right-hand man Thomas Cromwell](clippings/history/Rags-to-riches hero or villainous torturer The truth about Henry VIII's scheming right-hand man Thomas Cromwell.md)
A reversal of that in _A man for all seasons_. The author was an avid ex-catholic.

> In Bolt's telling, Cromwell is the big baddie, both ruthless and underhanded in his methods. More, Lord High Chancellor of England, and later venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church, is the hero, executed for refusing to swear an oath recognising the monarch as the supreme head of the Church in England. More's eloquent resistance, and faithfulness to the dictates of his own conscience, resonated amid the counter-culture of the 1960s.

cp. the way Lin-Manuel Miranda rehabilitated Alexander Hamilton.

## Prayer

### Lent 4

[[2025-03-30]]

(From Rohr _Wondrous Encounter_)

> As the High Holy Days draw near, this Sunday of the “Second Scrutiny” of the catechumens revolved entirely around the theme of light and seeing things truthfully. This problem is at the heart of what almost all ancients saw as the “**tragic sense of life**”. Our lack of self-knowledge and our lack of wisdom make humans do very stupid and self-destructive things. Because humans cannot see their own truth very well, they do not read reality very well either. We all have our tragic flaws and blind spots. Humans always need more “light” or enlightenment about themselves and about the endless mystery of God.

Why was I thinking of Trump when I read this rather than about myself?

N.B. the use of year A readings when in the context of the Catechumenate!
