The impact and culture of Facebook has proven to be destructive not only of individuals, but also of the world itself

I think of how I was so cautious about Emma's fascination with the app back in the "oughts" when she was an early teenager.

## History

### Thomas Cromwell reinterpreted

[[2025-03-28]]

[Rags-to-riches hero or villainous torturer? The truth about Henry VIII's scheming right-hand man Thomas Cromwell](clippings/history/Rags-to-riches hero or villainous torturer The truth about Henry VIII's scheming right-hand man Thomas Cromwell.md)
A reversal of that in _A man for all seasons_. The author was an avid ex-catholic.

> In Bolt's telling, Cromwell is the big baddie, both ruthless and underhanded in his methods. More, Lord High Chancellor of England, and later venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church, is the hero, executed for refusing to swear an oath recognising the monarch as the supreme head of the Church in England. More's eloquent resistance, and faithfulness to the dictates of his own conscience, resonated amid the counter-culture of the 1960s.

cp. the way Lin-Manuel Miranda rehabilitated Alexander Hamilton.
