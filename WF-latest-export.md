### Counterculture

- Sewing. Learn spinning. Gandhi. 

### Where is the outrage?

### Spiritual direction. Church. 

## From dinner. 

- What is the first food you are looking forward to when you get home? I don't look forward to getting home. Maybe Mary Pats cooking. 

### Etty Hillesum

### Confronting a dictator

### Church and Academia similar -- each getting squeezed to be controlled by Mafia Don

- Social contract: US and Universities
- What is your purpose? Defending endowment? Or standing up to a dictator? Values? Disavow ... 

### I somehow expect answers to appear on the long retreat. Instead I just get another day

### April 13

- (Palm Sunday)
  - Dinner
    -  #names Lottie & Stephanie. From Wales. 
    - #names Scott & Juanita. Chicago. Travel business. Clueless?About what I was talking about. When we're able to call for equality of income across the globe. Then we can call for equality of sacrifice for global warming. 
  - Hawai'i sensitivity training, history intro. 2pm
    - Nb that hula dancers don't jump. They remain connected to the aina. And that is pono. 
    - I felt such a pang of homesickness. The hula spokesperson related her own literal homesickness when she left her grandmother to go her own way. Only when she came home to her "calling", did she get well.
    - The presentation had elements of what I spent 13 years learning. l'olelo. pono. kuliana. hula as a spiritual matter. David Kalakau as the "Merry Monarch" restoring ancient values.

## April 11 

### Pago pago

- It seems surprising to me how familiar and Home like it feels here in this country city village. The standard of living is so far behind anything I have known.
- It seems like it has something to do with having known people from American Summer. People I understood to be friends. I think I could live here very happily the last years of my life. But obviously as Allen reminded me last night Mary Pat couldn’t do that.
- Somehow, in the mystery of that there is a message for me and how to respond to current events once I get back to where I live. It’s not home, but where I live.
- What is that mystery? Perhaps it’s a call to simplicity. Mary Pat would be happy with that. I’m not sure how it fits except for perhaps tomorrow is going to the desert.
- In the store next to the national Park visitor center there was a lot of fabric that was Polynesian Pacific Islander kind. And sold examples of the Fiji sulu. 599 was a common price  I think Joan fabric carries something similar for about 35 99
- Perhaps I could make clothing to sell or giveaway advertising, or proceeds to go to…
- Mahatma Gandhi spinning thread in the last of his life. The other day I saw a picture of all of his possessions when he died. Two slippers, maybe a hat or two other things.

### Charlotte 

I don't know how to say how much your hospitality meant to me yesterday. Vinaka. Mahalo. thank you from the bottom of my heart. Tell Luisa, thank you for her gift of the fan. I hope things go well with your husbands tests and doctor's appointment. A friend from church who had been a practicing Jew in his youth told me that good friends don’t say "shalom" but rather "l’hitraot", meaning "until we meet again". I prefer shalom because it has deep meanings of peace. But I also like the thought of "til we meet again" because it means we are good friends, you and I, and we shall meet again. Thank you.
