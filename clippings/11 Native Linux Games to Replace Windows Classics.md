It probably comes as no surprise that, despite most computers having access to fabulous games, many people still enjoy the pure simplicity of classic pack-in Windows games like _Solitaire._

Well, if you've moved on from Windows to the greener pastures of Linux, you don't have to give up those idle minutes before you clock out for the day spent dragging virtual cards around or trying to figure out the likely location of landmines. For just about every classic Windows game, there's a Linux equivalent.

## 11 Aisleriot (Replaces Windows Solitaire)

    ![Official screenshot of Aislerot running the Klondike variant of solitaire.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aisleriot-3-10.png)

GNOME Foundation

If you didn't figure it out right away, [_Aislerot_](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps(2f)Aisleriot.html) is an anagram of Solitaire, and I choose to believe it's pronounced "I'll rot", but I've never heard anyone say it out loud, so don't judge me.

This is pretty much Windows' Solitaire game, but you can choose from over 80 variants of this simple yet engrossing game. So if you're just too good at the vanilla Solitaire ruleset, you can shake it up and pick a style of Solitaire that will really make you pull your hair out.

## 10 Gnome-Mines (Replaces Minesweeper)

    ![Gnome mines official screenshot.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gnome-mines-official-screenshot.png)

GNOME Foundation

I knew a young woman when I was in high school who was an absolute monster at Minesweeper, and it all seemed like psychic magic to me, until I got a little older and understood how it all worked. I think she went on to be an accountant or something dull like that, but clearly if you are a bored accountant or someone with a head for logic, probability, and numbers in general, [_Gnome Mines_](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-mines/stable/) is a great way to stave away that dreary existence.

I have never flagged them all...

## 9 Space Cadet Pinball (Replaces, Well, You Know)![Space Cadet Pinball on Linux.](https://static0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/space-cadet-pinball-on-linux.jpeg)

Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 was the first time I got to experience _3D Pinball for Windows – Space Cadet_, which I later learned was really just a cut-down version of a game called _Full Tilt! Pinball_, which had two additional tables. I really enjoyed this game, though it had nothing on [_Epic Pinball_](https://www.gog.com/en/game/epic_pinball_the_complete_collection) which is still my favorite digital pinball game of all time—I still play it today!

[_Space Cadet Pinball_](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.k4zmu2a.spacecadetpinball) is a neat reverse-engineered version of the game for Linux and macOS.

It pretty much looks and plays just like I remember, but even if you have no nostalgia for this particular game, if you like pinball and have a Linux installation, it's absolutely worth playing still.

## 8 Hearts (Replaces Windows Hearts)

Everyone knows and loves solitaire, but _[Hearts](https://snapcraft.io/hearts)_ never got its just deserts if you ask me. I always ignored it in Windows because I thought you had to play it online, but it turns out you can just play against the computer, which is how I got into it. There are several Linux versions, but the one I've linked to seems to be actively supported and works on a wide variety of distros.

## 7 Gnome Mahjong (Replaces Microsoft Mahjong)

Ken VanDine

I have distinct memories of playing _Mahjong_ on my dad's office computer in the 90s, and despite not knowing what the heck I was doing, I managed to have some fun with it. It's important to point out that this computer game version is actually Mahjong Solitaire, which is a game where you simply have to match two identical tiles to each other and remove them from the board. If you manage to clear the board, you win. Mahjong Rummy is a four-player game where the object is to remove all your own tiles, or have the lowest score by the end of the game, so completely different games that are played with the same tileset, just like Western playing cards.

Smooth fonts, multimedia, and more. Anyone up for a game of Minesweeper?

## 6 0 A.D. (Replaces Age of Empires)

    ![Official screenshot of the Roman Empire in 0 AD.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/shewolf.jpg)

Wildfire Games

Microsoft's _Age of Empires_ is one of the greatest games in history, and was pretty awesome because we could convince our teachers that the game had educational value. My school actually bought copies of AOE to install in our computer labs. Actually, maybe it _does_ have educational value and we're being fooled? No, no, it's the teachers who were wrong.

For one thing, the game is properly beautiful, and certainly stands up as a modern-day real-time strategy games visually. What really stands apart, through is the commitment to realism. 0 A.D.

Each civilization is different in how it looks and plays. So it's an asymmetric RTS in the vein of _Starcraft._ Units can gain experience and rank up, so keeping them alive matters. It uses real battle formations, which brings elements of the _Total War_ series into play. Some units can perform both civilian and military roles. The maps are based on real historical geography too, and the naval battles are currently being worked on to turn them into a much more realistic game system.

## 5 DreamChess (Replaces Chess Titans)

    ![Screenshot of an ongoing Chess game in DreamChess.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/screenshot-2025-03-30-at-10-01-27.png)

Almost twenty years ago, Windows 7 included a pretty slick chess game called _Chess Titans_, developed by Oberon Games. Given how popular chess is in the world, it's a little surprising that Microsoft waited until Windows 7 to include it, and even stranger that they never did it again.

Nonetheless, if you're running Linux, you have a number of different chess games you can install and play. If you're a serious player, then it's best to combine a chess engine like [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) or [GNU Chess](https://www.gnu.org/software/chess/) with a [Chess GUI](https://official-stockfish.github.io/docs/stockfish-wiki/Download-and-usage.html#download-a-chess-gui) of your choice.

## 4 QCheckers

    ![QCheckers official screenshot.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/qcheckers-official-screenshot.png)

While there was never an official Checkers game developed by Microsoft that I can find, or bundled with any version of Windows, there have been versions of the game hosted on MSN, and plenty of takes on the classic board game in the Microsoft Store.

_[Kreversi](https://snapcraft.io/kreversi)_ is a Linux take on the classic game, and is very much still maintained, with the last update as of this writing early in March 2025.

## 2 Gnu Backgammon

Microsoft never made its own Backgammon game for Windows, but it's been a favorite classic time-waster on Windows systems regardless, with various publishers trying their hand at it. Certainly, our Windows 3.1 computer had at least one version of this game.

    [![Windows 1.0 Retail Box Photo Hero](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/windows_1_hero_1.jpg)](https://www.howtogeek.com/700661/35-years-of-microsoft-windows-remembering-windows-1.0/)

The first version of Windows was released 35 years ago. Here's what it was like, and how it laid the groundwork for Microsoft's future.

## 1 PokerTH

While I may have no idea how to play Backgammon, I am more than familiar with Texas Hold 'Em poker. Maybe too familiar since I was a little obsessed with the game in my early 20s.

Video game versions of the game abound, though I guess people who play for real money tend to get their poker fix using online, web-based versions of the game. Nonetheless, if you want an app you can install and play offline on your Linux system, [_PokerTH_](https://snapcraft.io/pokerth) will get the job done.
