_The Bulwark_’s [Andrew Egger](https://substack.com/redirect/9c87e3fb-5319-471a-b62f-cf18d4ed67c0?j=eyJ1IjoieG00Z2wifQ.cMPmiHfhApMk--EgRKQgXwBmONUL9XrWZ5hRR7JL2P8) coined a phrase recently that had me rolling on the floor.

> Instead, less than two months after his inauguration, Trump has been Reverse Jesus, speaking new economic storms into existence. His will-he-or-won’t-he trade-war tap dance with Mexico and Canada has markets genuinely freaked.

He meant it in a sort of functional way—While Jesus was about renewal and resurrection, Reverse Jesus is about destruction and implosion. Whatever Reverse Jesus touches dies.

But then it got me thinking about all the warnings I grew up hearing about the Anti-Christ. In evangelical end times theology, the Anti-Christ is often described as a singular person whom many people will mistake for the Second Coming of Christ but who is actually Satan in disguise. Within a broader [biblical interpretation](https://substack.com/redirect/5b9009e5-4e12-4633-9b64-c2a28131f5e7?j=eyJ1IjoieG00Z2wifQ.cMPmiHfhApMk--EgRKQgXwBmONUL9XrWZ5hRR7JL2P8), it’s not a person per se, but a general danger, a spirit, a distortion of the Gospel. Anti-Christs exploit and capture Christians to exalt themselves.

I grew up being told the Anti-Christ would be a highly appealing, gifted person who would be well versed in scripture and mounts a subtle deception with actions that seem beneficial and brilliant for society. Too many Christians would fall for him as a result, and we had to be constantly on the lookout.

Of course, he would be a Democrat or other soulless humanist, which would narrow the field and help Good Christians identify him. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, with their charisma and brains, were considered possible candidates.

Well, it turns out that it’s the Anti-Christ’s dumb-as-lint brother who has actually done in the church: Meet Reverse Jesus.

Reverse Jesus is basically a toddler with a nuclear bomb of glitter. He has no good qualities, solves no problems, has no talent other than superhuman shamelessness, and brings absolutely nothing to the table. He’s not even physically attractive. He just makes a f\*\*\*ing mess.

And he’s not subtle at all. He basically puts on an Anti-Christ suit covered in 666 and runs around shouting, “Look at me, I’m the Anti-Christ! ha aha hahaha! What a fun game!”

A thing that actually exists

He’s like a 3 year old girl who puts on a Belle costume from the Disney store and orders her mother to bow down as if she is actual royalty. And then her mother does that, but not for pretend. She rearranges their entire household to serve the needs of the Princess. Ok, so I’ve just described normal American parenting these days.

|  |  |  |

Let’s try again. It’s like the toddler informs her parents the family dog is now the King, and the parents start having the dog make all their financial decisions based on which treat he eats first.

|  |  |  |
|--|--|--|

Or rather, it’s like the parents take their entire savings out of the bank in cash and lights it all on fire so they can make s’mores. YUM!

The American church has fallen for Reverse Jesus hook, line, and sinker. The Anti-Christ has booked an extended vacation to Tahiti because he sees he’s not even needed.

|  |  |  |

Reverse Jesus accomplishes the same thing as the Anti-Christ, but with less effort. Reverse Jesus buys up souls in bulk at a discount club. Because the souls already lowered their price a long time ago. With “cheap grace,” in the words of Dietrich Bonhoeffer.

Congrats, white American Christians! The writers of scripture didn’t bother to warn about Reverse Jesus because they couldn’t imagine how easily you’d be fooled.

And relatedly, the Founding Fathers foolishly factored a virtuous citizenry into their system of checks and balances.

This week my #OneThing has included the unfurling of the world’s largest Ukrainian flag, participating in a Better Together group at my church, attending an interfaith vigil, and launching a fundraiser I didn’t quite think through…

I had made this painting for our Ukrainian friends Tetiana and Serhii.

Their immigration status is now in legal jeopardy because the administration [announced](https://substack.com/redirect/5fe4495d-9262-4448-90ff-3747e48c5710?j=eyJ1IjoieG00Z2wifQ.cMPmiHfhApMk--EgRKQgXwBmONUL9XrWZ5hRR7JL2P8) their parole program will soon end. This endangers the futures of 250,000 Ukrainians in America. We are helping them file an asylum case that may at least buy them some time.

You can hear more about their story [here](https://substack.com/redirect/be6d14c5-f7ba-455d-af59-7a211a52c143?j=eyJ1IjoieG00Z2wifQ.cMPmiHfhApMk--EgRKQgXwBmONUL9XrWZ5hRR7JL2P8). You can donate to their legal aid [here](https://substack.com/redirect/a68c5393-25b8-488c-b16d-17bdd387750f?j=eyJ1IjoieG00Z2wifQ.cMPmiHfhApMk--EgRKQgXwBmONUL9XrWZ5hRR7JL2P8).

It got me thinking—What if I sold duplicates of the painting and donated all profits to Ukraine charities? What a great idea! I put out an announcement on social media. And then immediately got 22 orders. Each painting takes a few hours to make=I now have a lot of work to do!

But no worries! I am happy to do this work. It is a calming activity for me, and I’m thrilled that maybe these paintings could help some folks. I also have some friends coming over Sunday to help me cut out fabric and do some of the labor.

If you would like a painting, you can order it [here](https://substack.com/redirect/1b90b9fd-71c8-4a54-a351-387dca630123?j=eyJ1IjoieG00Z2wifQ.cMPmiHfhApMk--EgRKQgXwBmONUL9XrWZ5hRR7JL2P8). Maybe wait a couple weeks? ha.

You guys are out there inspiring me right back with your #OneThing. My dear friend Tammy in Ohio has been burning up the protest game with her 80-something-year-old mom, Loretta. Tammy has become quite the sign artist. She made this one for Loretta, who retorted that Tammy herself could just as well carry it.

Stay spicy, Loretta.

I’ve been trying to educate myself about Black theology lately, so in that vein, I read two books this week, Esau McCaulley’s R_eading While Black_ and James Cone’s classic _The Cross and The Lynching Tree_. I’ll have more to say about this probably next week, but my take away for now—Black American theology is far more grounded in ethics—the practical working out of belief in the here and now—than white theology has been. Even when there’s shared doctrine (many Black Christians are inerrantists), the results are pretty different.

Which helps explain why Black Christians as a collective have not fallen for Reverse Jesus. The ones that have anecdotally seem to be ones ensconced in primarily white evangelical spaces.

Grace and Peace, friends. Go well. Godspeed.
