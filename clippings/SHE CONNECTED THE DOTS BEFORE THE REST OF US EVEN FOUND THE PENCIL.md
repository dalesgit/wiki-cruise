# SHE CONNECTED THE DOTS BEFORE THE REST OF US EVEN FOUND THE PENCIL

Heather Cox Richardson just handed us the clearest, most unflinching blueprint of how the U.S. government is being dismantled under the second Trump administration—and she backed every word with receipts. Her March 27, 2025 dispatch isn’t analysis. It’s evidence. It’s a field report from the front lines of a soft coup.

The scale of what she wrote felt too outrageous to be real, but every word of it is.

Venmo payments with eggplant emojis tied to a Signal chat about bombing the Houthis?

A Department of Government Efficiency that’s already cost the U.S. $500 billion?

The IRS gutted. HHS torched. Social Security collapsing?

Surely this was speculative—some dystopian metaphor.

It wasn’t. Every detail she cited came from _real reporting_ by _real journalists_ in **Wired**, **The Washington Post**, **Reuters**, **NBC News**, **The New York Times**, and more.

Richardson didn’t theorize—she _documented_. And the result is devastating.

Here’s just a fraction of what she laid out:

-   **DOGE**, Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” has cost **$500 billion**—10% of all IRS revenue from last year.
    
-   Words like “climate crisis,” “diversity,” “segregation,” and even “peanut allergies” are being purged from federal communications.
    
-   And **J.D. Vance is now in charge of purging the Smithsonian** of what the administration calls “anti-American ideology.”
    
-   **20,000 IRS employees fired**, especially in enforcement. Billionaire audits? Gone.
    
-   **HHS cut $12 billion in mental health and disease tracking grants**, then laid off **10,000 more workers**, including **3,500 from the FDA** and **2,400 from the CDC**.
    
-   **Social Security’s website crashed 4 times** in 10 days. New rules require in-person ID checks for people without internet.
    
-   A **Tufts student was detained by ICE** after writing a pro-Palestinian op-ed.
    
-   **The Department of Education is being shut down.**
    
-   **FEMA is next.**
    
-   **Columbia University had $400 million withheld** until it complied with Trump’s cultural directives.
    
-   **Mike Johnson is openly floating the idea of eliminating federal courts.**
    

This isn’t dysfunction. It’s doctrine.

It’s **Project 2025**, written by **Russell Vought**, now head of the Office of Management and Budget, and championed by Vance, who once said:

> “Unless we overthrow \[the current ruling class\]… we’re going to keep losing.”
> 
> and
> 
> “We really need to be really ruthless when it comes to the exercise of power.”

Heather Cox Richardson took that ruthlessness seriously. She traced it from the eggplant emoji to the ICE van. From the IRS to the Smithsonian. From the layoffs to the list of banned words.

She didn’t write a warning.

She wrote the truth.

And she deserves **our full attention**.
