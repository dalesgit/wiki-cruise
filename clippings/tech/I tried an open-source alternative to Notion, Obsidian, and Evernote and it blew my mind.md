# I tried an open-source alternative to Notion, Obsidian, and Evernote and it blew my mind

> ## Excerpt
> This app replaced my entire workflow

---
But after weeks of testing, I can confidently say AFFiNE didn't just meet my expectations – it blew them away. This isn’t just another note-taking app; it’s a significant shift in how we manage information and I’m here to tell you why it might just replace your existing workflow.

## A robust template library

### Huge time-saver in your workflow

Notion's biggest advantage is its extensive [template library](https://www.xda-developers.com/youre-missing-out-if-you-havent-tried-these-notion-templates/). Being a new tool on the market, AFFiNE has done a solid job with the template collection. Whether you want to create a goal tracker, test analysis report, assignment tracker, summary generator, resume, or fitness planner, your pre-built structure is just a click away.

As expected, these templates aren't rigid. They're designed to be flexible and adaptable. You can easily modify them to fit your specific requirements. These templates also serve as excellent examples of how to use AFFiNE's features.

## Host of customization options

### Tweak the entire workspace

    ![reasons-AFFiNE-is-best-Notion-and-Obsidian-alternative-2](https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/03/reasons-affine-is-best-notion-and-obsidian-alternative-2.jpg)

Here is where AFFiNE truly surprised me. Traditional tools like Notion and Evernote have limited customization options. However, with AFFiNE, you can enable translucent UI on the sidebar, enable or disable AI, tweak font style, enable spell check, page width, and more.

The customization options are even better with the infinite Edgeless Canvas. You can change the default theme, tweak background shade, shadow style, border style, thickness, text color, connector style, mind map look, and much more. I highly recommend spending some time in the **Settings > Editor** menu to create a personalized setup.

## An intuitive block editor and seamless organization

### Master the slash command

AFFiNE has covered the basics here. It ditches the traditional toolbar in favor of a modern block editor where you can use the slash (/) command to format your docs. This modular approach allows you to easily arrange, rearrange, and manipulate content.

As for organization, you can create folders and subfolders and start adding docs to them. AFFiNE takes it to the next level with Collections. They function as smart folders where you can manually add documents or automate with rules. Overall, it has nailed docs organization, and you won’t have a hard time finding relevant information.

## Built-in digital journal

### A crucial part of the second brain

A digital journal is an essential part of my [PKM system](https://www.xda-developers.com/best-tools-effective-personal-knowledge-management-system/), and AFFiNE doesn’t disappoint. It comes with a dedicated Journals menu where you can add new notes and glance over the entries using the calendar integration. You can use AFFiNE's block editor to create different sections within your daily entries. At any point, you can switch to AFFiNE’s Edgeless Canvas (more on that later) to map out your day.

## Edgeless Canvas

### Brainstorm ideas like a pro

Edgeless Canvas is where AFFiNE easily beats traditional tools like Notion, Obsidian, and Evernote by a mile. Whether you are researching a complex project, breaking down a large project, planning a summer trip, or simply creating mind maps for tricky subjects, you have ample options to design an effective whiteboard.

## Capable databases

### Add multiple column types

Although AFFiNE’s database options are limited compared to Notion, it has covered the basics with tables and Kanban boards. For instance, you can insert a table and use multiple column types like checkbox, date, multi-select, number, progress, link, and text. You shouldn’t have a hard time designing an effective database. Kanban board also offers the convenience of handling small projects like a pro.

## Privacy-focused and open-source

### Have a peace of mind

    ![reasons-AFFiNE-is-best-Notion-and-Obsidian-alternative-11](https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/03/reasons-affine-is-best-notion-and-obsidian-alternative-11.jpg)

Unlike Evernote and Notion, AFFiNE is built with a strong focus on user privacy. Being an open-source solution, the code is available on GitHub for anyone to inspect. Any researcher or security expert can review the code and verify the company’s privacy claims. You can self-host AFFiNE as well.

## A second brain that actually works

In the end, my journey with AFFiNE wasn’t just about finding a new app; it was about changing the way I interact with information. If you are looking for a powerful alternative to established players like Notion, Obsidian, and Evernote, AFFiNE delivers on its promise of a flexible and effective second brain.

Of course, being a new tool, it’s still evolving, and I would love to see performance improvements, better UI, and a graph view in future updates. If it doesn’t work for you, check out other [capable Notion alternatives](https://www.xda-developers.com/best-notion-alternatives-with-offline-mode/).
