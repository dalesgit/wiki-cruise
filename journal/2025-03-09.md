Trying to insert 2 carriage returns in text (as exported with markclipper)

- cf. a remapped keybinding: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27819225/inserting-two-new-lines-in-vim#:~:text=the%20first%20by%20pressing%20%3Cleader,two%20lines%20after%20your%20current.
- better suggestions https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/3875/how-to-insert-a-newline-without-leaving-normal-mode
- plugin to add "[<space>" etc.
