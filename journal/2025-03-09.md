 ## Trying to insert 2 carriage returns in text (as exported with markclipper)

- cf. a remapped keybinding: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27819225/inserting-two-new-lines-in-vim#:~:text=the%20first%20by%20pressing%20%3Cleader,two%20lines%20after%20your%20current.
- better suggestions https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/3875/how-to-insert-a-newline-without-leaving-normal-mode
- plugin to add "[<space>" etc. https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired
- Some interesting possible solutions, including using "cat" https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12812/replacing-multiple-blank-lines-with-a-single-blank-line-in-vim-sed

> If you were already in vim and wanted to stay there, you could do this with the internal search and replace by issuing: :`%s!\n\n\n\+!^M^M!g` (The ^M is the visual representation of a newline, you can enter it by hitting Ctrl+vEnter), or save yourself the typing by just shelling out to cat: :%!cat -s.`

!! finally I solved what I was looking for:

1. set nowrap
2. :%s/\n/\r\r/gc
3. keep responding "y" to each query
4. set wrap (if desired)
