# The plan today

<! -- markdownlint-disable -->

Today we are in New Zealand fiords.

## Turning off the very annoying linting (i.e. "markdownlint-diable")

## turning it off <https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint>

To disable all markdownlint rules, add a <!-- markdownlint-disable --> tag before the text, and a <!-- markdownlint-enable --> tag after the text.

To disable only a specific rule, add the rule number to the tag, for example <!-- markdownlint-disable MD044 --> and <!-- markdownlint-enable MD044 -->.arkdownlint>

<https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1ai07lx/anyway_to_disable_linters_in_lazyvim/> gives directions for various levels of disabling. **!**
