## Things to do

- [ ] Transportation in Seattle. We decided together that it would be so much easier to rent a car. It will be in the $300-$400 range. But more versatility and simpler.
- [ ] bought the photos of our trip. Mark 9:28 Luke 10:27 tatooed on his neck. MP asked about the woman who took the photo. He lit up when he said it was his wife.
- Mark 9:[26](https://www.biblestudytools.com/ceb/mark/9-26.html) After screaming and shaking the boy horribly, the spirit came out. The boy seemed to be dead; in fact, several people said that he had died.[27](https://www.biblestudytools.com/ceb/mark/9-27.html) But Jesus took his hand, lifted him up, and he arose.
- Luke 10: [26](https://www.biblestudytools.com/ceb/luke/10-26.html) Jesus replied, " What is written in the Law? How do you interpret it?" [27](https://www.biblestudytools.com/ceb/luke/10-27.html) He responded, "You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your being, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and love your neighbor as yourself." [28](https://www.biblestudytools.com/ceb/luke/10-28.html) Jesus said to him, " You have answered correctly. Do this and you will live."

## Reflection

### I'm challenged by

- In a matter of 5 days apparently, a week-long headache and blurred vision turned into surgery for a brain tumor for Julie Johnson.

### What I did well today

### What I've learned today

- #tech getting rid of extra lines: %!cat -s
- cf. https://www.google.com/search?q=vim+how+type+ctrl+m+character&rlz=1CAHCKU_enNZ1156&oq=vim+how+type+ctrl+m+character&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDg3MjBqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
	- https://www.baeldung.com/linux/vim-m-character-meaning#:~:text=To%20enter%20the%20%5EM%20character,M'%20it%20will%20not%20work. re. the "ctrl M" character.
	- Question more or less says it all. I'm aware that `/^$/d` will remove all blank lines, but I can't see how to say 'replace two or more blank lines with a single blank line'
	- If you aren't firing vim or sed for some other use, cat actually has an easy builtin way to collapse multiple blank lines, just use `cat -s`.
	- If you were already in vim and wanted to stay there, you could do this with the internal search and replace by issuing: `:%s!\n\n\n\+!^M^M!g` (The ^M is the visual representation of a newline, you can enter it by hitting Ctrl+vEnter), [ctrl+v, ctrl+W]or save yourself the typing by just shelling out to cat: 

```
:%!cat -s`. 
```
> [This seemed to work like magic]. What does it mean?
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/706076/vim-delete-blank-lines
```
:g/^$/d

`:g` will execute a command on lines which match a regex. The regex is 'blank line' and the command is `:d` (delete)
```

## Things I'm grateful for.

- I prayed morning prayer this am. What came to me was that I could get excited about going home to starting an "underground church".
- MP doesn't know how to deal with me saying, "I don't look forward to going home."
