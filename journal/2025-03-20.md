:dream: #dream

The waking dream, tossing and turning, going over and over. Ostensibly I was at a Cathedral sort of place. I was veteran, things had changed. But I was still tabbed by someone to be a substitute presenter and a cathedral school or some such. 

Partly because we had been with the couple from Sheffield, I was aware of being cut off from my children. I think Somehow the effects of my spouse I was frustrated over and over from being prepared with all my materials from getting to the time of the presentation.

On waking and a little bit of reflection, before getting coffee, I thought it was also about the takeover of the government and the shear violence, inhumanity, and bullying of the administration. Bridget was a stand-in for the new Dictatorship of Amerika.
