## Things to do

- [x] Visit with Charlotte

## Reflection

### I'm challenged by

- The power of my physical reaction to saying goodbye to Charlotte. The exquisite joy in seeing her response as I leaned into her "space" on the sidewalk, 21 y/o daughter Luisa looking on, and I asked, "Are you Charlotte?" It tooker her moment and then she burst out loud, "Fr. Dale!"
- The visit has made the cruise worthwhile to me. What do I do next with it?

### What I did well today

- Listening, asking questions. 

### What I've learned today

- 4-fold response to polarized conversations
- The collapse of sugar around the world. Why does it cost so much to produce? Has the demand dropped massively?

## Things I'm grateful for

- Obviously connecting with Charlotte. Remembering Isaiah and Florence running around.
- Mary Pat's willingness to travel along and even to connect with Charlotte.
