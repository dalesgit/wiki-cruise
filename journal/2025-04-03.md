### Gratitude

- Mary Pat and the woman who looked like Christine: Judy / Ian #names -- Connie & Kim (both from BC) Kim reminded of?

- This is so simple and yet so little understood.

### - [After DOGE Targeted V.A., an Iraq Veteran Faced Uncertainty and Crisis - The New York Times - www.nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/30/us/doge-iraq-veteran-fired.html?searchResultPosition=1)
- "A veteran who returned from Iraq injured and transformed, Joy Marver is now facing a crisis at home."

- This presumption of canniness is fallacious even when applied to highly competent politicians, who are coherent perhaps 70 percent of the time. So you can imagine how wide of the mark it falls with Trump, who—impaired already by malignant narcissism and functional illiteracy—demonstrates on a near-daily basis growing signs of cognitive decline (the latest example being his petulant response last weekend to whether the tariffs would raise auto prices: “I couldn’t care less”). If Trump were your elderly grandpa, you’d have taken the car keys from him months ago and would be starting to investigate assisted living.

### - [Ezra Klein on Trump, Vance and free speech: ‘It feels like we are in one of the darkest imaginable timelines’ - www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/apr/02/ezra-klein-on-trump-vance-and-free-speech-it-feels-like-we-are-in-one-of-the-darkest-imaginable-timelines?dcr=apps&edition=us)
- "Actual reform – rather than wanton destruction – is all the more urgent now that we’ve seen what happens when the state fails to effect positive change. “Look, the fact that the Biden administration was not able, despite passing all this historic legislation, to deliver government improvements on a timeline people could feel, and that that helped open the door to the return of Donald Trump, who is now running a hack and slash operation to destroy government under the guise of efficiency – that is exactly why it is really important liberals make government work."

A 10 percent tariff will apply to all countries, but trading partners like China, Japan and Europe will face rates two and three times as high."

The reorganization that began on Tuesday will scale back an agency that has been a public health model around the world."

### - Woman at Billiard. I gestured that women's bathroom was on other side. She came back to tell me how she liked my hair. I told her since 2016. That I was a priest. She wouldn't believe me. I told her of Diane and ? Came to church because of man bun. #gratitude

### - [New modelling reveals full impact of Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs – with the US hit hardest | RNZ News - www.rnz.co.nz](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/on-the-inside/557085/new-modelling-reveals-full-impact-of-trump-s-liberation-day-tariffs-with-the-us-hit-hardest)
- *Analysis* - We now have a clearer picture of Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs and how they will [affect other trading nations](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/02/trump-hits-uk-with-10-tariffs-as-he-ignites-global-trade-war), including the United States itself.
- The US administration claims these tariffs on imports will reduce the US trade deficit and address what it views as unfair and non-reciprocal trade practices. Trump said this would "forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed".
- The "reciprocal" tariffs are designed to impose charges on other countries equivalent to half the costs they supposedly inflict on US exporters through tariffs, currency manipulation and non-tariff barriers levied on US goods.
- Each nation received a tariff number that will apply to most goods. Notable sectors exempt include steel, aluminium and motor vehicles, which are already subject to new tariffs.
