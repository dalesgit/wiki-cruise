I have finished reading *An Interrupted life & Letters from Westerbrook. *

It is extraordinary. Like nothing else. And is my main hope in returning to live in the place we are calling *Home.*

### [DeX vs Chromebook](https://www.howtogeek.com/ways-samsung-dex-better-than-chromebook/#:~:text=If%20you%20mention%20using%20Samsung%20DeX%20on%20a%20lapdock%2C%20you%20can%20bet%20someone%20will%20tell%20you%20that%20the%20latter%20purchase%20is%20a%20waste.%20You%20can%20get%20a%20Chromebook%20for%20that%20money!%20Thing%20is%2C%20there%20are%20things%20a%20lapdock%20and%20DeX%20can%20do%20that%20a%20Chromebook%20cannot)
- If you mention using Samsung DeX on a lapdock, you can bet someone will tell you that the latter purchase is a waste. You can get a Chromebook for that money! Thing is, there are things a lapdock and DeX can do that a Chromebook cannot

- A crackdown on political dissent is well under way in Germany. Over the past two years, institutions and authorities have cancelled events, exhibitions and awards over statements about Palestine or Israel. There are many examples: the Frankfurt book fair [indefinitely postponing]([https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/09/palestinian-author-adania-shibli-frankfurt-book-fair](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/09/palestinian-author-adania-shibli-frankfurt-book-fair)) an award ceremony for Adania Shibli; the Heinrich Böll Foundation [withdrawing the Hannah Arendt prize]([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/14/award-ceremony-suspended-after-writer-masha-gessen-compares-gaza-to-nazi-era-jewish-ghettos](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/14/award-ceremony-suspended-after-writer-masha-gessen-compares-gaza-to-nazi-era-jewish-ghettos)) from Masha Gessen; the University of Cologne [rescinding a professorship]([https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/apr/10/nancy-fraser-cologne-university-germany-job-offer-palestine](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/apr/10/nancy-fraser-cologne-university-germany-job-offer-palestine)) for Nancy Fraser; the No Other Land directors Basel Adra and Yuval Abraham [being defamed]([https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/27/israeli-director-receives-death-threats-after-officials-call-berlinale-antisemitic](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/27/israeli-director-receives-death-threats-after-officials-call-berlinale-antisemitic)) by German ministers. And, most recently, the philosopher Omri Boehm [being disinvited]([https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/philosoph-omri-boehm-darf-bei-buchenwald-gedenkfeier-nicht-sprechen-a-b764ce35-cfee-488c-a7b2-e478d23c3f21](https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/philosoph-omri-boehm-darf-bei-buchenwald-gedenkfeier-nicht-sprechen-a-b764ce35-cfee-488c-a7b2-e478d23c3f21)) from speaking at this month’s anniversary of the liberation of Buchenwald.

- Research on the underground railroad, the network of activists helping enslaved people escape to the northern states in America or Canada, has shown that influential church leaders [played a crucial role](https://www.amazon.com/Bound-Canaan-Underground-Railroad-America/dp/0060524308). They refused to follow federal legislation that obliged them to help slave owners capture enslaved people that had escaped.
- Teaching others about morally courageous figures can work, but heroism is not the key for all learners. The science suggests a number of other – perhaps surprising – objectives which can move ordinary people to stand up for democracy. In particular, educational initiatives [that boost contact between different groups](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-35832-004) may be useful.

Things to do:
Excursion to missiles. 


Reflection
I’m challenged by today:
Such a beautiful serene approach into the dock. Placid water. Sunrise. Mountains in the distance. Noumea. 

What I did well today:
Reading the French signs on the museum. 

What I’ve learned today:


Gratitude

They call le grande Terre “the mainland”
Clearly WE2 was a watershed time for NC. Political cultural changes that are still unfolding. Interment just like US. More NZ soldiers than US. 

Guide reminded me of Chaminade student. Strong French accent. 

Factory visible on Harbor visible for the nickel.

25 September, 11:00 P.M. Tide told me that a girlfriend once said after the death of her husband, "God has moved me up into a more advanced class; the desks are still a little too big for me." And when we spoke about his not being there anymore and how strange it was that neither of us felt empty inside, indeed had a sense of fulfillment, Tide simply ducked her head and shrugged her shoulders and said with a brave little laugh, "Yes, the desks are still a little too big, things are bound to be a bit difficult now and then."
