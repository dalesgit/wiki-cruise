## Reflection


### I'm challenged by

- #wonder I wonder about how I have had a hard time understanding lyrics since -- like forever. Is it a matter of my hearing? Brain connections? It feels like the same thing I experience now where I know someone is speaking, but I can't process, decipher, decode the sounds into words.  
- About differences of Micronesia, Melanesia, Polynesia

### What I did well today

- 

### What I've learned today

- Islands are defined when they are on the same techtonic plates. Greenland on the North American plate. Australia it's own plate.
