It seems that nothing more needs to be set to get most of wiki-vim working. The one thing so far is that I can't create a file. I may have had a similar problem previously, thus my need to create journal files in Obsidian-nvim.

Lots to remain to do in getting Markdown working well.

Automatic indent of a file, (like e.g. to straighten out Obsidian-nvim) cf. https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/19945/auto-indent-format-code-for-vim


```To indent the whole file automatically:

gg
=G
Explained:

gg - go to beginning of the file
G - go to end of the file
= - indent
```
