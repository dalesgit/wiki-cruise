major food source and meeting place for
indigenous Australians. Early European
settlers used it primarily for agricultural
transportation.

vast Royal Botanic Gardens founded in 1846,
and the Melbourne and Olympic Park Sports
Precinct, considered Australia's premier
sports complex.

1857. You'll also see Melbourne Park, the

Centre. Watch for the Grand Prix site and St
Patrick's and St Paul's Cathedrals.
Walk through the grand Fitzroy Gardens to

paths, a superb collection of trees, a gorgeous
conservatory and the cottage that was once
the home of Captain James Cook's parents in
England. It's the only 18th-century building
remaining in Melbourne. View the cottage
and learn about Captain Cook's life and times.
Originally built in 1755, the little house

honors the man who discovered and skillfully
charted Australia's eastern coastline. Built by
Cook's father in 1755 from sandstone and
brick, the cottage was dismantled and
transported from the village of Great Ayton in
Yorkshire, England, to its present site in 1933.

Your final stop is at the Shrine of

Sydney, Australia - Sunday, March 30, 2025: 

First came the Aborigines, 50,000 years ago; then 759 British
convicts, followed by a wave of military settlers known as the “Rum Corps.” The result: Sydney’s bold, egalitarian charm. History, opera,
opals and koalas are all here.

## Discover the Blue Mountains
Departs: 8:00 AM
Approximately 8½ Hours
Adult $279.95; Child $249.95

Travel west of Sydney by motorcoach towards
the Blue Mountains. Despite its name, this
UNESCO World Heritage site isn't
mountainous at all. In fact, it's an area of
scenic, rugged, low-elevation tablelands
covering more than 2.5 million acres. Some
wonderful cultural and landscape surprises
await you.
Visit Featherdale Wildlife Park for an
introduction to the amazing (and very
bizarre) spectrum of Australian wildlife. Just a
few feet away from you -- and in some cases
roaming quite freely within the park -- are
wallabies, kangaroos, koalas, reptiles,
Tasmanian devils, wombats and many
Australian species of bird. Photo
opportunities abound, and you can pay extra
to have your photo taken with a fuzzy koala
who enjoys cuddles as much as you do.
At the Blue Mountains, you'll realize that the
attraction here is not what rises above but,
rather, what lies beneath. A stop at the Echo
Point viewpoint shows what the "mountains"
are all about -- they are canyons deeply
incised through the tablelands, with some
intriguing landforms carved by wind and
water. You will have a very impressive view of
the Three Sisters -- eroded columns whose
existence has given rise to a wealth of

Aboriginal lore. Take in panoramic views of
the Jamieson Valley, Mount Solitary and the
Ruined Castle as well.
At Scenic World, take a ride on the Scenic
Cableway -- Australia's steepest aerial cable
car. Crossing 886 feet above the Jamison
Valley; enjoy the views of ancient ravines and
dazzling waterfalls.
A two-course traditional lunch is served at
the Mountain Heritage Hotel. Boasting
unrivalled views over the Blue Mountains,
this quaint property lends an old-world,
English-style ambience to your day.
