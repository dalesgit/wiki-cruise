50-minute cruise on the beautiful Yarra River.
Although Melbourne is situated on the shores
of one of the largest bays on the Australian

major food source and meeting place for
indigenous Australians. Early European
settlers used it primarily for agricultural
transportation.
Enjoy a different perspective of the city as you
motor past some memorable landmarks -- the
vast Royal Botanic Gardens founded in 1846,
and the Melbourne and Olympic Park Sports
Precinct, considered Australia's premier
sports complex.
Next, a narrated panoramic drive takes you
past the ornate Princess Theater, built in
1857. You'll also see Melbourne Park, the
Melbourne Cricket Ground, and the Arts
Centre. Watch for the Grand Prix site and St
Patrick's and St Paul's Cathedrals.
Walk through the grand Fitzroy Gardens to
discover huge formal garden beds, walking
paths, a superb collection of trees, a gorgeous
conservatory and the cottage that was once
the home of Captain James Cook's parents in
England. It's the only 18th-century building
remaining in Melbourne. View the cottage
and learn about Captain Cook's life and times.
Originally built in 1755, the little house

honors the man who discovered and skillfully
charted Australia's eastern coastline. Built by
Cook's father in 1755 from sandstone and
brick, the cottage was dismantled and
transported from the village of Great Ayton in
Yorkshire, England, to its present site in 1933.

Your final stop is at the Shrine of
Remembrance -- permanent memorial to the
ANZAC spirit and to the men and women of
Victoria who served and died in the Great
War.

Sydney, Australia - Sunday, March 30, 2025: First came the Aborigines, 50,000 years ago; then 759 British
convicts, followed by a wave of military settlers known as the “Rum Corps.” The result: Sydney’s bold, egalitarian charm. History, opera,

Discover the Blue Mountains
Departs: 8:00 AM
Approximately 8½ Hours
Adult $279.95; Child $249.95

Travel west of Sydney by motorcoach towards
the Blue Mountains. Despite its name, this
UNESCO World Heritage site isn't
mountainous at all. In fact, it's an area of
scenic, rugged, low-elevation tablelands
covering more than 2.5 million acres. Some
wonderful cultural and landscape surprises
await you.
Visit Featherdale Wildlife Park for an
introduction to the amazing (and very
bizarre) spectrum of Australian wildlife. Just a
few feet away from you -- and in some cases
roaming quite freely within the park -- are
wallabies, kangaroos, koalas, reptiles,
Tasmanian devils, wombats and many
Australian species of bird. Photo
opportunities abound, and you can pay extra
to have your photo taken with a fuzzy koala
who enjoys cuddles as much as you do.
At the Blue Mountains, you'll realize that the
attraction here is not what rises above but,
rather, what lies beneath. A stop at the Echo
Point viewpoint shows what the "mountains"
are all about -- they are canyons deeply
incised through the tablelands, with some
intriguing landforms carved by wind and
water. You will have a very impressive view of
the Three Sisters -- eroded columns whose
existence has given rise to a wealth of

Aboriginal lore. Take in panoramic views of
the Jamieson Valley, Mount Solitary and the
Ruined Castle as well.
At Scenic World, take a ride on the Scenic
Cableway -- Australia's steepest aerial cable
car. Crossing 886 feet above the Jamison
Valley; enjoy the views of ancient ravines and
dazzling waterfalls.
A two-course traditional lunch is served at
the Mountain Heritage Hotel. Boasting
unrivalled views over the Blue Mountains,
this quaint property lends an old-world,
English-style ambience to your day.

Oahu's Scenic Shores
Departs: 8:00 AM
Approximately 4 Hours
Adult $129.95; Child $109.95

Enjoy this scenic, narrated drive along the
south and east shores of the Island of Oahu.
Start with a journey past world-famous
Diamond Head, Hawaii's most recognized
landmark. This extinct volcano was named by
sailors in the 1800s who, from a distance,
mistook the glitter of calcite crystals in the
lava rock for diamonds.

From there, drive through the residential area
of Kahala and out to Hanauma Bay, a curved
bay formed when the side of a crater collapsed
thousands of years ago. Keep an eye out for
humpback whales that frequent the waters
along this coastline.
You'll also travel past Halona Point -- a
famous blowhole where a geyser of seawater
erupts from a submerged lava tube. From
there, the ride takes you around Makapu'u
Point, rising 647 feet above the ocean and the
site of a prominent lighthouse. Pause to visit a
gift shop with restrooms and time to enjoy a
tasty, cool island treat.
From the higher elevation of the Ko'olau
Mountains and the Pali Lookout, take in
sweeping views of the island's lush windward
side. It was here, in 1795, that King
Kamehameha I forced hundreds of his
opponents to jump to their deaths from the
cliffs.
Sit back and contemplate the beauty of Oahu
on the scenic and relaxing ride back to the
ship.

the time of making your reservations online, we will advise
you whether or not your reservations are confirmed or
whether you have been waitlisted. Your credit card will be
charged immediately for all confirmed reservations. Should
space become available for a waitlisted tours request, we
will e-mail or otherwise contact you at that time and either
immediately charge your credit card if you have already
given us your credit card information or ask you to provide
us with that information for immediate charge processing.

Please note that the Cancellation Protection Plan covers
pre-booked tours, including Overland Adventures and
Overnights, if cancellation is made up to 24 hours prior to
commencement of cruise. Tours cancelled within 24 hours
prior to commencement of cruising or while on board are
not covered by the Cancellation Protection Plan and are
subject to the above penalties. In the event a complete tour
is cancelled by Holland America Line or the tour operator,
pre-booked refunds will be handled on board. Very shortly
after each booking deadline/cancellation date, e-mails are
sent from the ship to the agencies concerned, informing
them of our definite requirements for meals, seats on
aircraft, number of automobiles and motorcoaches, etc., and
commitments are made. If notice of cancellation is received
after the booking deadline/cancellation date, a refund can be
assured only if the ticket is resold. Guests are encouraged to
pre-purchase tours. We recommend speaking with the Shore
Excursions Manager on board if you have any questions
about your physical ability to take part in any tour. Should
you opt not to take the tour following this discussion, full
reimbursement will be made provided the cancellation is
made within 24 hours of boarding the ship. For Overland
Adventures and Overnights, due to the in-depth nature of
the adventures, most areas are not accessible to wheelchairs
and require a considerable amount of activity.

Scooters

Depending on the port, the tour operator(s) may impose
weight restrictions for electric scooters and/or additional
charges may apply.
