  - [There is no such thing as an ‘illegal immigrant’ | Mehdi Hasan | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/02/undocumented-people-no-such-thing-as-illegal-immigrant)
    - This is so simple and yet so little understood.

    - This presumption of canniness is fallacious even when applied to highly competent politicians, who are coherent perhaps 70 percent of the time. So you can imagine how wide of the mark it falls with Trump, who—impaired already by malignant narcissism and functional illiteracy—demonstrates on a near-daily basis growing signs of cognitive decline (the latest example being his petulant response last weekend to whether the tariffs would raise auto prices: “I couldn’t care less”). If Trump were your elderly grandpa, you’d have taken the car keys from him months ago and would be starting to investigate assisted living.

        - MAT in Secondary Education With Math Licensure
        - April was an exceptional student in my class. There is a great deal of reading and writing in EDUC 790 and though it is a challenge for any student, it is especially true for students for whom English is not their first language. April seemed to thrive in such an environment. I didn't have an opportunity to actually observe her interaction with teachers and students in a classroom environment, but I would have every expectation that she will more than adequately meet the expectations of student teaching.

        - Chelsey is very good at being self-reflective and learning from her own experience. She has a passion for teaching that has motivated her to seek this degree. In our class she made good connections between the environment of the classroom and the larger society that produces and influences our classroom settings.

  - Keeping notes outside of orgmode
    - Editors
      - **Stackedit** for markdown editing. Similar to orgmode with no folding. Pandoc can get md to org. This seems pretty powerful. Both Dropbox and Google Drive synch? Macro capable. **Value is in posting to blog**
      - **DIllinger** Dillinger is an online cloud-enabled, HTML5, buzzword-filled Markdown editor. http://dillinger.io/ Links with Dropbox and GDrive. Shows the words written, but there is no obvious export.
      - **Writebox**? distraction free editing, does preview markdown nicely. The fact that it has a running word count is perhaps a really positive thing. Import/Export Dropbox and GDrive. -- chrome-extension://bbehjmjchoiaglkeboicbgkpfafcmhij/app.html
      - **Caret**: is an offline text editor (like "Sublime Text" which has won over emacs and vim users?) This does both offline and GDrive. Some nice power, with regex search, macro recording.
      - **checkvist**: for folder/outline/todo kinds of stuff (maybe organizational?)  it does links so maybe can link to google docs? checkvist exports to "opml" which can import into org.
      - **Neutron Drive** integrates with GDrive and has regex search. It does have keyboard shortcuts: move lines, folding, etc. macro recording, etc. It also has syntax highlighting, but how use? (No Dropbox, but tight with GDrive) especially designed for coding.
      - **Zed Project**: text editor that can do offline or GDrive or Dropbox. Zed is a fully offline-capable, Chrome-based text and code editor you can use to edit files locally, on Dropbox, or remotely on any server. It has all the code editor features you'd expect and more: http://zedapp.org/
      - **TextDown** seems like a very comfortable editor for working within Chrome. It is compatible with offline -- doesn't integrate easily with cloud. It seems to default to saving in the "Downloads" folder -- obviously good for Chromebox. http://brettterpstra.com/2012/08/26/textdown-markdown-editor-for-chrome/
      - **TiddlyShare**: http://daleshi5.tiddlyspace.com/
      - **Quabel** quick distraction free, files kept in cloud, but good export to Latex, docx etc. https://quabel.com/
      - **Markable.in** good export to dropbox, gdrive. Preview. http://markable.in/editor/
