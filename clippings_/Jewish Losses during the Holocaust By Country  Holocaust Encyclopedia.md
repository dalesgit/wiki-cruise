> ## Excerpt
> Before the Nazi rise to power, the countries of Europe had varied and vibrant Jewish communities. By 1945, two out of every three European Jews had been killed.

Before the [Nazi takeover of power](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/narrative/65/en) in 1933, Europe had a vibrant and mature Jewish culture. By 1945, most European Jews—two out of every three—had been killed.

When attempting to [document numbers of victims](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/narrative/11652/en) of the [Holocaust](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/narrative/72/en), the single most important thing to keep in mind  is that no one master list of those who perished exists anywhere in the world. The estimates of today might rise or fall as new documents are discovered or as historians arrive at a more precise understanding of events.

The best estimates for Jewish losses country by country are offered below. All figures are estimates and subject to change with the discovery of new documentation.
