sizes, from dust-specs in a larval rearing tank
to full size paua with pearl inserts. Don’t miss

approximately 1 hour.

This charming city anchors one end of
Marlborough’s wine trail. Marlborough
contains more than 60 wineries and produces

soils are ideally suited for fine Riesling, Pinot

showstopper is the Sauvignon Blanc, which
accounts for one third of the region’s planted
grapes.

the differing flavors of wines and what to look
for in the varietals, and enjoy a tasting at each
