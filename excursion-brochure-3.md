A great way to see what makes Vanuatu tick is
to learn about the traditional villages that
comprise Port Vila. Because only limited
archaeological information is available, most
of the story begins with Vanuatu's chaotic
British and French colonial history when it
was known as the New Hebrides. The next
step was Independence in 1980 and, today,
you will encounter the Port Vila life of the
21st century at the bustling Central Market
and the Mahitahi Handicraft Market.
Stops en route include various scenic
lookouts, Parliament House, the Council of
Chiefs, Erakor Wharf, Independence Park,
and the market houses.

Some venues, such as markets or cultural
sites, may be closed on special occasions.
Tour sequence may vary. Shade is limited; to
avoid sunburn, wear light, long clothing
suitable for use as a cover-up. Bring a hat and

lagoon, where you're invited to take a
refreshing swim.
Cruise the Epule Jungle River to meet village
warriors who perform vibrant customary
dance and song. Taste and enjoy local kaikai
-- a mixture of our root crops cooked in an
underground oven.
From the picturesque Top Rock, breathtaking
scenery precedes a delicious buffet lunch and
some snorkeling in the gorgeous waters
below.

side of the island and the largest harbor in
Vanuatu, and pause at Kleim's Hill Lookout
for amazing views over Mele Bay, Hideaway
Island and the town in the distance.
Notes:

bring a towel, reef-safe/biodegradable
sunscreen, light clothing to act as a full cover-

Board a pre-paid minibus for the short
transfer to the semi-sub pontoon. There you
will climb into a semi-submersible for a cruise
along the reef where you will encounter the
underwater wonders of Vila.
Large underwater viewing ports offer an upclose view of the reef and its colorful
denizens, from clownfish -- think Finding
Nemo -- to parrotfish and damselfish. Watch
as the fish crowd against your semi-sub at
feeding time. Your vessel does not actually
submerge -- large below-water ports offer an
up-close view of the reef and its denizens.
Take the opportunity to snorkel afterwards at
a favorite spot where the fish are quite
friendly.
Guests who wish to stay in town to shop or
explore independently are welcome to do so
but must make their own way back to the
ship.
Notes:

suited to the weather conditions. Wear your
swimsuit under your clothing; bring a towel,
