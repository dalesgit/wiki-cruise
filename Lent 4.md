## (From Rohr _Wondrous Encounter_)

> As the High Holy Days draw near, this Sunday of the “Second Scrutiny” of the catechumens revolved entirely around the theme of light and seeing things truthfully. This problem is at the heart of what almost all ancients saw as the “**tragic sense of life**”. Our lack of self-knowledge and our lack of wisdom make humans do very stupid and self-destructive things. Because humans cannot see their own truth very well, they do not read reality very well either. We all have our tragic flaws and blind spots. Humans always need more “light” or enlightenment about themselves and about the endless mystery of God.

Why was I thinking of Trump when I read this rather than about myself?

N.B. the use of year A readings when in the context of the Catechumenate!
