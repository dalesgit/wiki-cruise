# What Vanished From Maui’s First Resort Town Will Shock You - Beat of Hawaii

> ## Excerpt
> Behind the beaches and resorts of Maui’s most iconic resort town lies a story few visitors know—how the people who made the magic were squeezed out, and what that means for travelers today.

When you visit Kaanapali on West Maui today, it looks like the perfect escape. But hidden beneath the beaches and resorts is a story few visitors know—how the people who made paradise possible were squeezed out, and how what replaced them changed everything about the Valley Isle experience.

In the 1960s, long before resort profits soared and vacation condos replaced everything else, Kaanapali was built as a complete community. Developers didn’t just build rooms for guests. They built dorms, townhouses, and off-site apartments for staff. Today, nearly all of that housing has vanished. In its place: pools, tennis courts, and a growing sense that something important, something critical, was lost.

A Maui resident named Diane recently commented to us: “When Amfac created, built, and developed Kaanapali as a destination, the hotels had employee housing. Why did it end?” (Amfac was the powerful plantation company that created Kaanapali, transforming West Maui’s old sugar fields into Hawaii’s first master-planned resort).

This is that story.

## The early vision: Housing for workers and Maui visitors.

In 1962, Amfac launched Kaanapali Beach Resort on Maui’s west side. It was Hawaii’s first master-planned resort community and sat on former sugar land once owned by Pioneer Mill. The project began with the Royal Lahaina Resort, and adjacent to it, Amfac built housing for its employees.

There were low-rise townhouses just inland of the hotel, and a building that later became the Kaanapali Ocean Inn, which reportedly served as employee housing in its earliest years. At the time, Kaanapali was isolated. Lahaina was still a small town. The idea of building housing alongside resorts wasn’t radical—it was necessary.

Throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, Amfac continued to expand the concept. Other hotels followed: the Sheraton in 1963 and the Ka’anapali Beach Hotel in 1964. All relied, in part, on Amfac’s employee accommodations. Eventually, the company supplemented its on-site units by constructing off-site apartments in Lahaina, most notably the Maui Islander Apartments around 1980.

The goal wasn’t just convenience. It was continuity. Stable, nearby housing meant a stable workforce. The people who cleaned rooms, ran kitchens, and kept the grounds could also afford to live nearby—many with families in tow.

## The turning point: When housing became real estate.

By the mid-1980s, the resort’s priorities began to shift. The land that had once been used to house workers had become some of the most valuable property in the state. And resort operators started asking a new question: Why give prime beachfront land to low-rent employee housing when it could be used for guest amenities?

The answer came quickly. The Royal Lahaina townhouses were torn down and replaced with guest features, including a tennis court. The employee dormitory, once a place for staff to sleep, was rebranded as the Kaanapali Ocean Inn—a budget-friendly wing for guests.

Amfac itself was also changing. The company was sold to JMB Realty in 1988. Sugar was declining, and tourism was taking over. New owners weren’t interested in maintaining workforce housing. Instead, the company turned to a new strategy: homeownership.

In 1979, as part of a negotiated agreement with the ILWU and Maui County, Amfac committed to building the Kelawea Mauka subdivisions in Lahaina. These single-family homes would be offered to hotel and plantation workers at cost. The idea was to shift housing responsibility from the resort to individual ownership. Once built, Amfac stepped away from housing altogether.

## Maui Islander: From apartments to vacation condos.

Few properties better illustrate the shift than the Maui Islander Apartments. Built around 1980, it was a 360-unit complex initially used to house workers at the Kaanapali resort, just a short commute away, according to historical accounts.

But by the late 1980s, those apartments were already being rented to visitors. By the 1990s, the complex was operated by Aston and rebranded as the Aston Maui Islander. The workforce housing had effectively been phased out, quietly and without formal announcement.

In 2003, the property was sold again, this time to developers who planned a major $30 million renovation. By 2007, it had been transformed into Aina Nalu Lahaina, a boutique condo-hotel managed by Outrigger. Renovation estimates placed the investment at around $30 million, though final costs were not publicly confirmed. Units were consolidated and upgraded. Pools, tropical landscaping, and a Balinese-style open-air lobby replaced the old apartment-style design.

What was lost was one of the last dense, affordable housing options near the resort zone. What was gained was another visitor-facing property with no link to its original purpose.

## The role of water, permits, and zoning.

Another quiet force behind the disappearance of housing was infrastructure. Kaanapali has its private water utility, initially run by Amfac and now managed separately. In the 1960s and 70s, this system enabled the resort to build quickly—supplying both guest accommodations and employee housing.

But as demand for pools, golf courses, and new hotel wings grew, so did competition for water. Some accounts suggest that the removal of employee housing may have helped free up water capacity later used for guest-related development, though direct documentation is limited. Water access remains one of the most significant limiting factors in any new development on Maui.

Meanwhile, zoning rules favored tourism. Resort areas weren’t required to maintain employee housing once early conditions were fulfilled. Without regulations to preserve these units, resorts quietly transitioned them into guest spaces—or removed them entirely.

## What stands there now.

The townhouses that once housed Royal Lahaina’s workers are gone. The dormitory that became the Kaanapali Ocean Inn now books visitors instead of employees. The Maui Islander is a condo-hotel.

Even the Napilihau duplexes, once a modest source of workforce housing, have mostly been sold off. Only the Kelawea Mauka subdivisions remain, but they are far from Kaanapali’s core and were never rentals.

Walk around the resort today, and you won’t find any signs that workers once lived where tourists now lounge. The housing footprint has been erased from the land—but not from memory.

## What this means for visitors.

If you’ve noticed slower service, fewer staff, or more stress on your last Maui trip, you’re not alone. And this history may help explain why.

Without nearby housing, resort workers now commute from central or even upcountry Maui. That can mean 45 minutes or more each way, especially during peak traffic. It adds to stress, fatigue, and turnover, affecting the visitor experience in quiet but noticeable ways.

The shift also contributes to Maui’s broader housing crisis. With fewer rentals available for working families, prices have surged, and long-time residents have been pushed out.

Some of the very people who helped build Kaanapali are now priced out of the communities they once served.

## What readers are saying.

The question that sparked this article came from Diane, a reader from Beat of Hawaii, living on Maui. Her comment captured what many residents feel:

“There are a few residentially zoned condos still within Kaanapali’s Resort. What happened to the rest? How did the Maui Islander Apartments become an Outrigger Hotel?”

Another reader wrote, “I remember when Kaanapali was a place for both visitors and workers. Now it feels like it’s only for tourists.”

That shift—from shared space to exclusive one—is at the heart of what happened. And it’s not just history. It’s a question about the future of tourism in Hawaii.

## Can tourism and community needs be balanced?

As Maui recovers from the devastation of the Lahaina fire and reassesses its tourism model, the legacy of Kaanapali’s lost workforce housing offers a cautionary tale.

Can resorts reinvest in employee accommodations? Will future developments include space not just for visitors, but for those who serve them?

These are questions without easy answers. But the more travelers understand this history, the more we can all be part of shaping what comes next.
