Things to do:
Roger and Lorena from #names Vancouver. Joanne 85 from northwest Ohio. He was so obnoxious. 


Reflection
I’m challenged by today:
Mary Pat has wondered how it is that indigenous peoples knew and passed on the knowledge that it was necessary to care for the world (out they wouldn’t survive)
EH. What else is there to do than focus all that odd failing in ourselves. 

What I did well today:


What I’ve learned today:
While my mates were doing Woodstock and watching the man in the moon, I was traveling the world alone and poor. 
World Trade Center under construction 1969.

Gratitude
Queen Esther hostess at Canelleto 
Server Rei also was on Volendam 
One of those deeply healing metaphors is water, and we see it in both readings today. Ezekiel presents water flowing from every side of the temple as the source of life, endless fertility: all living creatures, fish, and trees “whose fruit shall serve for food, and their leaves for medicine.” What an excellent image of Divine abundance and the universal flourishing that comes from it! Rohr: wondrous encounters 

Starter Prayer
“Healing God, give me the courage to move forward, and help me to see that my deepest sin might be my unwillingness to keep growing.”

Awake from dream in afternoon. With a start I walked across a street. Seemed like toward 690 Dudley. I collapsed to the ground. I could see my body lying there. And I couldn’t speak though I tried and tried. I couldn’t move though I was using everything I had to try to move. I thought this is what it is like to have a stroke. I feared a car running over me as I lay there unmoving.
