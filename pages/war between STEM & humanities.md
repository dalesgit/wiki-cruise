## The Two Cultures Are One

## The war between STEM and the humanities comes to a disastrous end.

The National Science Foundation’s Judith Ramaley coined the acronym _STEM_ in 2001. The neologism became a handy new way to mark a dividing line in higher education discourse. Are STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) degrees better than Humanities degrees? Which are harder? Which are more useful? Which bring higher incomes, and which more career satisfaction? Which do we need more of? So thoroughly does this polarity now suffuse the way we talk about college and university that it can be found at every level, from policy statements down to school cafeterias. (“To be a STEM kid or a Humanities kid? That is the question,” announces [the Catalyst](https://recatalyst.org/4022/features/stem-kid-vs-humanities-kid-do-these-labels-matter/), student paper of the Ransom Everglades School in Florida. “The rise of STEM, the fall of humanities,” intones a story in Michigan’s Minnehaha Upper Academy’s [Redhawks Online](https://redhawksonline.com/2023/12/17/the-rise-of-stem-the-fall-of-humanities/).)

In fact, neither one of these labels names a particularly coherent group of fields. STEM covers endeavors as different in their workings and aims as heart surgery is from number theory, while humanities disciplines have little in common beyond an (often) qualitative interest in (usually) human concerns.

Less frequently observed is the asymmetry between the categories themselves. Humanities disciplines claim ancestry from the classical _studia humanitatis_—the grammar, rhetoric, poetry, history, and moral philosophy taught by Renaissance humanists—but include definitively 20<sup>th</sup>\- and 21<sup>st</sup>\-century interdisciplinary subjects (cultural, race, and gender studies, for example) and have a complicated and porous relationship with social sciences. Though they appeal to broad ideals of citizenship or critical thinking, further, they are, as professional disciplines, university-bound. (In other words, people who directly practice humanities for a living are mostly professors.)

[STEM](https://web.htk.tlu.ee/STEAM/handbook/chapter/chapter-1/), on the other hand, when Ramaley coined it, referred not merely to a list of academic fields but more specifically to integrated teaching in the relevant areas, from school onward, with the goal of creating a more competitive, innovative workforce. It was not so much a grouping of inherently similar types of inquiry, then, as an agenda for teaching functionally related subjects together, to achieve a set of national economic and strategic goals.

In other words, though the groups of disciplines are artificial, “humanities” and “STEM” do connote different ideas about the purposes of education and its relationship to the market. And while the labels took hold in universities as administrative shorthand for collections of departments and programs, they now shape how high school students think about their own intellectual capacities and futures. Are you a STEM kid or a Humanities kid?

It is on these linked fronts—student choice and perceptions of market demand—that the “STEM versus Humanities” framing comes closest to describing a real war. As Benjamin Schmidt showed in a much-cited 2018 [Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/the-humanities-face-a-crisisof-confidence/567565/) piece, STEM has had the best of it. Between the 2000s and the late 2010s, the share of undergraduates choosing majors in Humanities disciplines dropped across the board, sharply—by as much as 50 percent in disciplines such as history and English. STEM majors rose correspondingly over the same period. Schmidt argued that this was driven by expectations of future earnings, and many others note that it was encouraged by ubiquitous and bipartisan messaging portraying humanities fields as useless, from Barack Obama’s [dismissal of art history](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/01/31/obama-becomes-latest-politician-criticize-liberal-arts-discipline) to then-Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s [derision of anthropology](https://www.npr.org/2011/10/13/141305593/fla-gov-rick-scott-slams-anthropology-degrees). Cuts and closures have followed, reducing the humanities options available to students and accelerating the downward spiral.

For those in the humanities camp, resistance has sometimes felt futile. But it has come in the form of [better-than-imagined employment numbers](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2023/12/14/humanities-and-jobs-data-whats-the-real-story/) for humanities majors, surveys of lifetime earnings (the STEM advantage fades over time, as does the [relevance of tech skills](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo206855230.html) acquired in college), and critiques of the data. (There’s no such thing as a “STEM” or “humanities” salary, and many in all of those majors wind up in jobs unrelated to their degree.)
