I love my e-readers, you could say I have a collection - from the old Sony & Nook models to recent Kobos, I own about a dozen. e-ink is a dream come true for me, as a book nerd who happens to be a geek for tech gadgets as well.

I'd read enough about color e-ink to conclude that realistically the technology was still in its early stages, & purchasing a color device wasn't literally worth the money, since they tend to range on the pricy side of portable devices.

That opinion changed recently with early reviews of The Boox Go Color 7. Fast-forward to today, as I am typing this review on my own Color 7. I read & watched hundreds of reviews, Good e-Reader, Amazon, reddit, YT, etc. Mostly exaggerated, polarized & contradicting, & only a couple out of the hundreds I came across do justice to the device in my opinion - so I made it a goal to write a review that would answer all the questions I had before deciding to get the Color 7.

So let's clarify:

Kaleido 3.

Kaleido 3 is the latest gen of e-ink color, offering 16 levels of grayscale, 4096 colors, & faster refresh rates than its predecessors. Seems great right? But one detail that is not made obvious about Kaleido, is that the screens are rather dark compared to conventional black & white e-ink, & the colors & darker tones appear somewhat muted. I was expecting this before buying my Color 7, as I went to electronics stores & tested some k3 devices & noticed the screen's darkness right away. Lots of reviews online about the 7 consist of disappointed users complaining about this fact, but be aware that it's not just the 7, all Kaleido screens have the same quality. To be fair, the 7's screen is slightly darker than other Kaleido devices I tested, but definitely not by much. If you want to own a Kaleido device, you have to be ready to compensate for this - yet it's easy to do so: Sunlight, a direct light-source like a ceiling or desk lamp, or the device's convenient front-light will do the trick. Also for me, especially using the Boox's native Neoreader app, "Night mode" (black background, white fonts) allows me to read in the shade/low light settings without issues. Kaleido devices are not low-light friendly, keep that in mind, & the screens are quite dark without direct light on them, it's worse than you think if you've never seen one.

The infamous ghosting.

If you look at the Color 7's reviews, this is the most common complaint. Using the 7 for a few hours after unboxing it, I would have agreed, but here is the deal: The 7 is not as user friendly as other devices with a proprietary UI like the Kobo & the Kindle. The 7 features a unique hybrid UI between the Android OS & the Boox own custom e-reader UI, which in my experience provides the user with enormous flexibility & freedom of use, though at the same time requires a good amount of exploration, & more tweaking & tinkering than the aforementioned streamlined UIs. Adjusting the device to minimize ghosting requires a bit of a learning curve & it's by no means evident upon first use fresh out-of-the-box. Once you find out how it works, I promise you, you'll appreciate how much flexibility the different refresh rates & resolution settings give you, considering you'll have potentially dozens of Android apps running on your 7. However, I will not deny, there is indeed some initial tinkering involved, & I understand users who are not natural tinkerers, being stumped, or being reluctant to play with settings for every particular app. That said, the device doesn't suffer from "bad ghosting" issues in my experience, it's just that there's is no single toggle to reduce or turn off the ghosting globally, each app you run requires local settings to optimize it.

The Color 7,"nice reader, but too small, super fragile & on the cheap side."

Several negative reviews convey this in a nutshell, these users don't mind the UI & the custom Android rom, but complain about the device feeling small & cheap. I disagree, the device feels solid, a far cry from the early Kobos & Kindles that did feel like cheap plastic toys to me. The 7 is made with the same durable hard plastic & the protective ONYX Glass screens that the Boox devices feature, this design allows the device to feel sturdy, yet extremely lightweight. I'm a big fan of the padding on the back, a real comfortable texture, which provides an excellent grip at the same time. I have to point out though, that many Youtube reviews I watched exaggerate The 7's sturdiness. This is not a military grade gadget you can drop & drag around like some Android phones out there. I'd be very apprehensive about dropping this on the floor, or shoving it in the bottom or front pocket of my backpack, where it'd get smacked around. e-ink screens are sensitive, & even with a good protective case, I treat the 7 accordingly, & wouldn't personally take it for a camping trip, into a heavily humid environment, or anything of the like.

The complaints about the size make no sense to me. I mean, I assume everyone checks the specs before buying a device like this, & Boox & other brands offer different size alternatives. If you want bigger, buy bigger, that's it. Personally, to me 7" to 8" offer the best size for a portable device, smaller than that I can't fit much on the screen, larger than that & I feel I have to carry my device like a swaddled new-born & portability is compromised. The device is thin, but average for a recent e-reader/tablet. The cover adds some extra padding if that is an issue.

The Good, the Bad, & the Not So Ugly.

The main questions for which I found mostly contradictory & confusing answers while checking out reviews having been addressed, I will cap the review with a few personal observations about the 7.

This little e-reader/tablet is a performance beast. I honestly didn't give much thought to that Snapdragon 680 CPU & 4Gb RAM, I was mostly excited about experiencing & playing with color on e-ink. I was left jaw-dropped by how snappy & responsive everything runs. I've been using my 7 for text editing & heavy web-browsing, while having all my messaging apps & podcasts/music going, all while plugged/sycn'd to multiple Bluetooth peripherals. Not only everything responds faster than I can blink, but no hiccups or performance dips so far; better performance than my desktop, my laptop, & my phone in terms of snappiness & cycling through multiple apps.

The battery lasts longer than I originally expected, considering how much stuff I have going simultaneously on it, & being constantly connected to Wifi.

There are settings to improve the colors. As mentioned above, I had tested other Kaleido devices at hardware stores, & I had low expectations for the technology. Nonetheless, the 7 doesn't lack ways to customize your display, & tweaking & tinkering I discovered how increase the colors' "pop" & reduce some of the muted tones it's set up with by default - light years away still from LCDs, but considering it's not burning my retinas, it was pretty satisfying when I learned how to use the different color modes & adjust them to my liking.

Of course this not a 10/10 device. I will reiterate, I don't find it to be entirely user-friendly. I am lucky I am a natural tinkerer & having a Linux background, it was second-nature for me to go dig on all corners of the web to find info on how to maximize my 7's performance; having done so, I have to say there is no decent or consolidated documentation, Boox has some, but it's vague & the tutorials lack depth. It actually took me days to fine-tune the ghosting, & over an hour to find how to replace the native online dictionary & install the third party ones I prefer.

I find the tech companies are not clear enough about the Kaleido technology & its drawbacks, & Boox is no exception. The consumer should be aware to know what to expect & be prepared to adapt & maximize the benefits of this technology.

Nitpicks.

Despite the comfy back & good grip, I don't find the 7 that ergonomic, I find the corners too sharp, & it doesn't mold over my hand like other readers do. I also have to agree with many reviews that the side-buttons on both the Page & the 7 aren't great, I find them too small, too close together, & I have to press toward the edge for them to work, they just feel awkward, like a last minute design afterthought - the touch gestures do mostly compensate, as they are perfectly responsive, but I still would've liked decent side buttons.

The power button on the bottom of the device, & the USB-C port on the top right side always get in my way, I wish they were both together, & on the top edge clear from my hands & my peripherals.

To wrap up I will say, perhaps this device is for you if you truly want an e-reader/Android tablet hybrid. This is the case in my opinion of a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none, you can most surely get better dedicated e-readers, & more well rounded Android tablets than the 7; yet, in my experience, no other device combines both so well. In my case, some of its drawbacks are actually a plus, as an intermediate Linux user, I don't mind & rather enjoy having to go tinker with my system, but I absolutely acknowledge it's not ideal in a general sense, given the ease-of-use prevalent to most e-readers. This device's higher degree of complexity will confuse & stump some users, as reviews already illustrate it to be the case. To me this is not just an e-reader with some Android sprinkled on top, it's a true hybrid, & it excels at that as far as as I've used it.
