# Body Part Most People Don't Wash Enough, Dermatologist Warns - Parade

> ## Excerpt
> People prioritize washing the groin, face and armpits. But one overlooked body area is the feet and not washing it correctly can have huge health consequences.

---
When you're rushing through a quick [shower](https://parade.com/health/everything-shower), you probably hit the usual hot spots: underarms, groin and face. Those are the areas your parents always made sure you washed growing up, after all.

But thereâ€™s one often-overlooked body part that deserves just as much attention. And chances are, youâ€™re not washing it properly without even realizing it.

The body part in question? Your feet. "Feet are often one of the most neglected areas when it comes to basic hygiene," **[Dr. Hannah Kopelman, DO](https://kopelmanhair.com/)**, a dermatologist at Kopelman Aesthetic Surgery, tells _Parade_.

And that's a problem, since human [feet](https://parade.com/health/foods-that-cause-swelling-in-feet) can get pretty gross. They're the perfect breeding ground for bacteria, especially with all the moisture from sweaty socks. Add in the dirt and grime from walking barefoot, and itâ€™s a recipe for trouble. If you skip washing your feet or don't wash them properly, it's basically an open invitation for multiple bacterial and [fungal infections](https://parade.com/1140198/ericasweeney/home-remedies-foot-fungus/).

## How Dirty Are Your Feet, Really?

If you could zoom in on your feet with a microscope, youâ€™d see tiny germs all over, though that depends on how often (and well) you wash your feet.

In one [study](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/18/3503), scientists swabbed the soles of volunteers and found some eye-opening results. People who washed their feet had about 8,800 bacteria per square centimeter of skin. However, when they _skipped_ washing, that number skyrocketed to a million bacteria per square centimeter.

If these statistics don't knock you off your (hopefully now clean) feet, here's another. Researchers made headlines years ago when they were the first to study how much fungus lives on the feet. Their findings? Nearly [200 fungal species](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12171) live on the feet. Yes, really: your feet are a fungal wonderland. The heel had about 80 types of fungi, followed by 60 underneath the toenails and 40 other fungal species call the space between your toes home.

"I am often shocked by how many people don't take the time to scrub and clean their feet regularly," says **[Dr. Brandon Haghverdian, MD](https://www.hoagorthopedicinstitute.com/find-a-doctor/brandon-a-haghverdian-md/)**, an orthopedic surgeon specializing in foot and ankle surgery at Hoag Orthopedic Institute. "You have several thousand sweat glands on the soles of your feet, so you are basically inviting bacteria to grow and live on the skin."

Now, of course, there are millions of bacteria and fungi all over the human body. The mouth, for example, has about 700 different microbes crawling around. Some germs have a symbiotic relationship with the human body, where they protect the body from more harmful microorganisms in exchange for shelter.

The [foot is no exception](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jocd.13368). The problem lies in the number of infection-causing germs that accumulate when you don't wash your feet.

## What Happens When You Don't Wash Your Feet Every Day

Feet get dirty easily, even when they're covered in socks. Sometimes _because_ they are.

"Theyâ€™re enclosed in socks and shoes for hours at a time, creating a warm, moist environment thatâ€™s perfect for bacteria and fungi to thrive," Dr. Kopelman explains. "Plus, theyâ€™re constantly exposed to sweat, dead skin and, depending on your activities, dirt and grime. If you don't actively wash your feet, all of that can build up over time."

When you don't take proper care of your feet, you open the door to fungal infections like athleteâ€™s foot and the bacteria that cause smelly feet. Worse, if bacteria slip into your bloodstream through a cut or cracked skin, it can lead to even more serious infections.

"At a high level this is pretty inconsequential, outside of maybe having to deal with odor or unsightliness. It only takes one small crack in the skin for this bacteria to go deep enough to affect your joints and bone health," says Dr. Haghverdian.

## How To Wash Your Feet the Right Way

I hate to break it to you, but chances are, you're probably not washing your feet correctly.

"A lot of people assume that because the water from the shower runs down their body and hits their feet, thatâ€™s enough to keep them clean," Dr. Kopelman says. "But in reality, that's not true. Feet need direct attention just like any other part of the body."

Even if you skip a shower, Dr. Kopelman says people should ideally still give their feet a quick scrub with soap and water, explaining, "It doesn't have to be complicated. A quick clean, followed by drying them well, can go a long way toward keeping your skin healthy and reducing odor or infection risk." If you're active, prone to sweating or often wear closed-toe shoes, washing your feet daily should be a top priority.

Don't forget to scrub between your toes when you wash your feet, either. "I always recommend spending a few extra moments in the shower to actually scrub your feet with soap, paying special attention to between the toes, and making sure to rinse and dry them thoroughly afterward," Dr. Kopelman adds.

### Foot self-care tips

While unnecessary, if you want to pamper your feet, try using foot masks and exfoliators.

"If you have thickened skin, calluses, or get a lot of dry, rough areas on your feet, then using a gentle exfoliating product like a pumice stone, a urea-based cream or an occasional foot peel helps keep the skin smooth and healthy," Dr. Kopelman says.

Depending on your skin type, Dr. Kopelman says using these products once or twice a week is enough to refresh your feet. Anything more can cause tiny cracks or irritation that make your feet more vulnerable to infection.

Now stop dragging your heels and wash those feet.
