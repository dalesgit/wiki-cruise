            This presumption of canniness is fallacious even when applied to highly competent politicians, who are coherent perhaps 70 percent of the time. So you can imagine how wide of the mark it falls with Trump, who—impaired already by malignant narcissism and functional illiteracy—demonstrates on a near-daily basis growing signs of cognitive decline (the latest example being his petulant response last weekend to whether the tariffs would raise auto prices: “I couldn’t care less”). If Trump were your elderly grandpa, you’d have taken the car keys from him months ago and would be starting to investigate assisted living.
