# Dried Figs, Public Protests, and Spiritual Practices - dhath12@gmail.com - Gmail

**Holy Week has just begun.**

Today was an absolutely miserable, dispiriting day here in the United States. It is hard to watch — and harder to experience — one’s county falling into an abyss of mocking the law and inhumane evil.

Holy Week fits the mood of so many millions of us right now. The fog of helplessness and hopelessness has come ashore. I wanted to reach out tonight — and remind you that you are not alone. So, I’m sending along two things:

> 1) a short reflection on biblical readings for today and tomorrow (which I found helpful); and  
> 2) links to ALL TEN of the W practices of Lent in this single post.

Holy Week is a hard, traumatic story of an innocent man — who preached love and justice — being abused and used by a violent authoritarian power for its own purposes. And this week is, perhaps, more difficult than ever.

We need each other. Be with someone. Find a friend. Reach out. Don’t walk to Calvary alone.

**Below are stories of events in Jesus’ life on Monday and Tuesday, the two days following Palm Sunday.** Both passages are about figs and the temple — and Jesus’s words and actions on these days are, in effect, his answers to the Palm Sunday crowd’s pleas of “Hosanna! Save us!”

**On Monday,** the day following his protest parade, Jesus likened a fig tree that didn’t bear fruit to the temple full of collaborators whose ritual practices had displaced justice. But he didn’t just give a poetic sermon about the problem. He performed an act of public resistance against the corruption of faith and, by implication, political authoritarianism. Jesus initiated two protest actions in two days.

The elites wanted to kill him; the crowd loved him:

> _On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry.Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see whether perhaps he would find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. He said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard it._
> 
> _Then they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves; and he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. He was teaching and saying, “Is it not written,_
> 
> _‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’?  
> But you have made it a den of robbers.”_
> 
> _And when the chief priests and the scribes heard it, they kept looking for a way to kill him; for they were afraid of him, because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching._
> 
> _And when evening came, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city._ (Mark 11:12-19)

Comparing their disregard for justice to withering figs was one thing, but destroying their source of compromised and collaborator cash, well, that was something else entirely.

Monday is the day that Jesus went from being a curiosity or a spiritual irritation to an actual threat to those in charge. The crowds were pretty riled up.

A dying fig on a diseased tree.

**Tuesday,** the second day after Palm Sunday, began with that fig tree again, now withered away. His friends were amazed. But Jesus reminded them that faith could do anything including casting “this mountain” — Mount Zion, the mountain on which the temple was built — into the sea.

Faith in God is resistance to evil, whether that evil is sin within or injustice without — the hardness of our own hearts and the deadening inhumanity of unjust rulers. Jesus wants to save us from it all.

> _In the morning as they passed by, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots. Then Peter remembered and said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.” Jesus answered them, “Have faith in God. Truly I tell you, if you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and if you do not doubt in your heart, but believe that what you say will come to pass, it will be done for you. So I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours._
> 
> _“Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.”_ (Mark 11:20-25)

The entire day covers three entire chapters of Mark’s gospel and includes a series of confrontations between Jesus and those corrupt elites and the imperial collaborators who want to kill him. Some of the questions are theological, others political (the famous tax question is asked on Tuesday: _Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar?_). The authorities seem baffled by his responses and frustrated by his ability to turn the tables on them — especially after he’d turned tables over! The crowd, however, is still with Jesus even when his preaching turns apocalyptic (in Mark 13).

It was a long, grueling day. Of it, Marcus Borg and Dominic Crossan wrote, “It is evening on the Mount of Olives. Darkness is coming on, a darkness that will deepen as the week continues to unfold.”

But throughout, Jesus is still saving them. Both those who cheered on Palm Sunday and those who submitted to Pilate’s parade. He challenged the powers of domination and injustice, pulled back the veil on folly and fury of empire, and preached the Kingdom of God. He showed them all — the ones rooting for him and the ones scheming to kill him — another way to live.

We can be different, forgiven and free. We can bear fruit. A better world is possible. One of faith, hope, and love. That’s Holy Week. That’s the story.

I need this story. This week. I need it.

Here are the links to all ten of the [Lenten W Practices](https://substack.com/redirect/c1c2cf40-a01f-4aa5-a9a1-3f42d6d6d5a7?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg) in answer to the question, “What Are We Going to Do?”

These practices aren’t intended to be rituals or habits to escape the anxiety and pain — but are pathways and guides to honestly face ourselves, our fears, and the world with more courage and compassion. They are meant to help us all grow in a time when we might feel as if we are withering. We can be fruitful. Even now. Perhaps especially now.

### INSPIRATION

  
**This poem struck me as particularly relevant to the frightening, angst-filled Holy Week we now find ourselves in. “What are we going to do?”**

**At the moment, the ten practices are helpful. But we really, truly need to pray.**

_And if god is in everything—in the bend of the river  
and the apricot tree, the song of the blackbird  
and the awkward smile of the little ballerina  
in purple who wandered out tonight onto the stage  
to join a dance recital already in progress—  
a dance class that wasn’t even hers— yes, if god  
is in everything, and I believe god is—  
in the dishrag, in the man who throws  
bottles at the people marching for peace,  
even in this angriest red sliver of me,  
if god is in everything then maybe that is why  
I have started to want to pray to everything—  
or maybe more truly, to pray with everything—  
the wave, the blossom, the awkward smile,  
the dirty cotton, the broken glass, the rising ache,  
the wonder that opens in me when I trust  
there was never even a half of a moment when we all  
did not deeply, fully, wholly belong to each other._

**— Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer, [“How I’ve Started to Pray”](https://substack.com/redirect/20cca6d2-fe88-40e7-83b0-30361c77207b?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg)**

_**So I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer,  
believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.**_

_**Whenever you stand praying, forgive,  
if you have anything against anyone.**_

**— Mark 11:24-25a**
