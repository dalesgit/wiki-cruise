[[What is required of me in the church]]?
[[Evaluation of Etty Hillesum]]


### Etty

- Like Etty I have no particular deep trust in the religious **ritual** that I spent my life serving.
- Etty: It is the **listening** not the evaluating that is a signpost
- Etty: Participation in the **suffering** of the universe.
- Ever met a person who wasn't a (potentuial) **friend**?

### Kindness (Dalai Lama)

- **Kindness** to all, for all are fighting and an epic *losing* battle.
- What to do or act or talk to those who don't **care**? **Poison** others? **Bully**? Which is to say, "Rail against any who have sold out for sake of selves."

### Bonhoeffer

- Bonhoeffer's "God is dead" and "political action" is missing from the *Living Together* piece. [[church life journal - ND]] and [[Evaluation of Etty Hillesum]] value and appreciate her "modern" mysticism. Beyond church and theology. The radical living in the world.
- The sense of somehow being exempt or outside of what's going on in the world outside doesn't work for me anymore. **retreat**

### *How to stand up to a dictator* Maria Ressa

- Honor pledge
- Golden rule
- p. 34: 
> "whenever I was lost or needed to make a quick decision, I began to develop a formula: I look at what I'm afraid of, downplay my ego, then follow the Golden Rule and the Honor Code."
- 4-way test:
1. Is it the **truth?**
2. Is it **fair** to all concerned?
3. Will it build **good will** and **better friendships**?
4. Will it be **beneficial** to all?
