A study led by Professor Dan Lawrence, of Durham University in the UK, found that across 10 millennia, more unequal distributions of wealth correlated with longer-term human settlement. However, the team are keen to stress that one factor is not causally dependent on the other, giving hope that humankind's survival is not linked to ever-increasing inequality.

The research is part of a Special Feature of the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_, titled "Global Dynamics of Wealth Inequality."

Sustainability is defined by the UN as "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." The study investigated the relationship between the two key aspects of this definition: continuity and equality.

The team used data on house size from across the world, covering the last 10,000 years, analyzing records of over 47,500 homes across over 2,990 archaeological sites.

Differences in house size were used as a measure of inequality during different time periods. This data was then analyzed alongside information on the duration of occupation. In simple terms, how long people lived in a settlement before it was abandoned.

The findings revealed a correlation between the two measures â€“ with more unequal settlements (as measured through house sizes) tending to persist for longer. However, this relationship was not found to be causal, and instead both factors rose with the increased scale and complexity of human systems.

The research team believe the findings could help inform interventions to improve future [sustainability](https://phys.org/tags/sustainability/).

Speaking about the research, Professor Dan Lawrence, Department of Archaeology at Durham University said, "The UN definition of sustainability references our societies not only continuing to exist but becoming more equal.

"We wanted to understand the relationship between those two aspects and ask whether equality or inequality is historically more sustainable.

"What we found is that, as humankind's systems become larger and more complex, inequality has tended to increase alongside longer persistence. But the two are not mutually dependent, showing that humankind might be able to achieve sustainable persistence without the need for increased inequality.

"It is not the case that inequality is simply a necessary by-product of building complex, sustainable societies.

"We need to be aware of, and attentive to, the historical interplay between inequality and sustainability.

"At a time of ever-increasing wealth inequality and sustainability challenges, including [climate change](https://phys.org/tags/climate+change/), the lessons from the past 10,000 years could be invaluable for helping us to achieve a more equal, truly sustainable future."

The study was authored by researchers from across Europe and the U.S., drawing on a database collected by archaeologists from across the world. It was published as part of a special feature which has examined the origins and drivers of [inequality](https://phys.org/tags/inequality/) from multiple angles.

Each of the studies has utilized a specially compiled data set on house sizes across the world from the last 10,000 years, as well as information on societies across time, such as structures, hierarchies, agriculture etc.

Professor Dan Lawrence, Department of Archaeology, Durham, has also been co-author on eight other papers as part of this special feature.
