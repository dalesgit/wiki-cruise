Reflection
I’m challenged by today:
taking care of MP while not coddling her
Names
Dinner without our friends
Susan and Joe #names from Riverside. They’re Neptune almost 5 stars. Chris#names from Birmingham. Intensely shy. Traveling alone. I worked to try to draw him out but it was so difficult to understand his accent. Some success at letting him feel heard. I reacted negatively to Susan doing stereotyping Indonesian Filipino East European etc. shades Simon Wiesenthal. 

What I did well today:
Met the challenge pretty well. My back is tired.

What I’ve learned today:
She doesn’t re /spond particularly to my saying to her that I am scared and apprehensive about returning home
because I’m not sure what I should be doing/saying to the church: Bonhoeffer’s contributions were primarily about “beyond God” theology and action in an evil society.
Pope Francis condemns the US administration for its treatment of immigrants, deportation etc.
evidently lays it on the clergy to make that communication plain

Mass
Lent 4
I want to get the colored background. But it seems impossible. Evidently only possible in the iOS version. 
Prodigal Son 
Reading II
2 Corinthians 5:17-21
Brothers and sisters:
Whoever is in Christ is a new creation:
the old things have passed away;
behold, new things have come.
And all this is from God,
who has reconciled us to himself through Christ
and given us the ministry of reconciliation,




Gratitude
Grateful for MP buying a hat today. She looks more take charge than without it.
