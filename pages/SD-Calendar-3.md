## Carol email 4/10

Dear Spiritual Direction Friends and Colleagues,

I have been listening to **Turning to the Mystics** selected podcasts for a few years now.  I loved the podcasts on The Interior Castle (Mirabai Starr's translation) and have listened selectively to many others.  James Finley and Kirsten Oates are the hosts and it is a program of the *Center for Action and Contemplation*.

Many years ago I read the *Way of a Pilgrim*, an anonymous russian author.  It was impactful and enlightening as much as I could take in at that time.

This week, while on the treadmill at the gym, I listened to one of the casts in the series that they offered on The Way of a Pilgrim.  I intend to listen to all the casts.

What caught my attention was the text (*The Way of a Pilgrim*), of course, and for this podcast they offer brief conversations about the themes of pilgrimage and short, rich narratives from their listeners that reflect the themes of pilgrimage.  The themes are Quickened by God, Longing, Teacher and the Path, Surrender, Fulfillment, and the Divinity of Ordinary Life.  Listening to the readers' experiences brought up for me so many opportunities we have to witness and hold our directee's transforming experiences.

I am sending the link to the transcript because I was struck by the themes of pilgrimage as themes we may recognize in spiritual direction. Certainly, you can go to the site and listen to the podcast.  These questions emerged.  If God meets us where we are with what we need on the journey....a good question for the director to hold, ponder in the quiet of our hearts is where is he/she/they on the journey, or said another way, in the process?  And, What do these themes say about how God is present to us on our way?  I found this very helpful.

If you would like to discuss this further, let me know.  I would love a session online to reflect.  If a group arises I'll schedule a conversation.

**_I am glad to be sharing the journey.   with love, Carol_**
## Supervision forms

## Texts for Module 3

1. *Candlelight: Illuminating the Art of SD* by Susan Phillips
2. *Spiritual Direction: Beyond the Beginnings* by Janet Ruffing, RSM
## Assignments


1. ~Read texts and articles sent for discussion and make notes ~ including questions, stirrings, and noticings to process the material with your peers.
2. ~Candlelight Assignment due MAY 8 - choose one or more directees in book and share what SD skill you admired (and why) and what you might do different (and why). Like doing supervision with the author 
3. ~PRACTICUM: Work with ONE directee (or more if you’d like) this level. You will need at least two sessions with this person or persons. (three even better) Instead of verbatims, you will fill out a supervision form of your choice (to be supplied and explained in class, MUCH more fun than verbatims!), meet with me once for one-on-one supervision and another time with the class for peer supervision.

## Linda note 3/26

We can discuss it next week as we have a full class of verbatims tomorrow!  Please note that our first class on April 3rd will be open format--- I want you to be thinking about all you have learned so far and have questions ready for me re: where you would like some more support, clarification, etc regarding the skills of SD.  I do not want you to go into supervision mode until you feel as if you have a solid grasp of the practice!

## Note re. "tools"

Dear CAP Friends,

I look forward to convening back with you the next two weeks to wrap up this module.  Just for clarification, the verbatim assignment is like last time- create a faux verbatim that incorporates one issue from the books you read and use the skills you have learned from them.  You have so much to choose from - a discernment issue, working with a particular faith style, a core limiting belief etc.  We have learned about discernment tools, IFS informed SD, focusing, using creativity, etc.  Have fun with it!
