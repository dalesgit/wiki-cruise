## The study was published in 2016 and looked into how masturbating can lower the risk of prostate cancer

**A study looking into a link between orgasms and the development of prostate cancer has revealed how many times a man should ejaculate per month to prevent the disease.**

The American Cancer Society states that one in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate [cancer](https://www.unilad.com/cancer) during their lifetime, with over 35,000 men in the US said to have died from the horrible disease in 2025 so far.

Six in ten [prostate cancers](https://www.unilad.com/news/health/prostate-cancer-risk-increases-45-percent-220701-20250323) are diagnosed in men who are 65 or older, while the risk is said to be higher in African American men and in Caribbean men of African ancestry.

Prostate cancer is also the second-leading cause of cancer death in men, behind only lung cancer, the American Cancer Society [reports](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html).

As a result, it's important to understand what men can do to help minimise the risk of being diagnosed with the [disease](https://www.unilad.com/health).

Well, studies have found that ejaculating once every day can reduce your chances, with one study stating having 21 [orgasms](https://www.unilad.com/news/health/15-types-orgasm-expert-reveals-713115-20241111) a month reduces the risk of developing prostate cancer by a whopping 20 percent.

Researchers at Harvard University made the discovery after studying 31,925 men, who filled out three questionnaires about ejaculation frequency between 1992 and 2010.

The survey, [published](https://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838(16)00377-8/fulltext) in European Urology in 2016, stated: "We evaluated whether ejaculation frequency throughout adulthood is related to prostate cancer risk in a large US-based study.

"We found that men reporting higher compared to lower ejaculatory frequency in adulthood were less likely to be subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer.

"These findings provide additional evidence of a beneficial role of more frequent ejaculation throughout adult life in the aetiology of PCa \[prostate cancer\], particularly for low-risk disease."

Not only can masturbating reduce an individual's chances of developing prostate cancer, it's also said to promote better [sleep](https://www.unilad.com/sleep).

This was highlighted by German health insurance provider Barmer Krankenkasse, which previously advised: "Masturbation helps you fall asleep.

"If you can’t sleep again, just use your hand to pleasure yourself, or use a toy, then sleep comes all by itself."

On top of this, registered sex therapist Judith Golden [told](https://www.besthealthmag.ca/best-you/girlfriends-guide/6-healthy-reasons-to-masturbate) Reader’s Digest: Best Health how masturbation can be of great help to those who suffer from insomnia.

She said: "Just as people fall into a deep sleep after sex with a partner, because blood pressure is lowered and relaxation is increased through the release of endorphins, masturbation is a good sleeping pill.

"It is relied on by many as a nightly occurrence."

## Scientists reveal how many times people are having sex per month based on age in new study

## The findings provided some intriguing results about Gen Z

**Studies on the topic of sex seem to be endless these days, with new findings revealing how many times people are having sex per month based on age.**

I think it's generally believed the older you get the less action in the bedroom you are having.

But according to the new research, that's not necessarily the case.

A report done by researchers from Kinsey Institute at Indiana University details [how much sex](https://www.unilad.com/news/sex-and-relationships/amount-average-person-has-sex-annually-965209-20240713) each generation is having.

In particular, the study boffins looked at the average number of times people from different generations have sex on a monthly basis.

![The results were somewhat surprising. (Getty Stock Photo) ](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=1&width=3840&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/blt4f1c4e9fbc633083/66d8956782dfd925da7c3484/GettyImages-1484748357-3.jpg)

Experts completed the report, 'The State of Dating: How Gen Z is Redefining Sexuality and Relationships', in conjunction with the dating app Feeld.

3,310 users on the dating app were included in the study, and it provided some interesting findings about Gen Z.

The study concluded Gen Zers are having less sex and fewer [relationships](https://www.unilad.com/sex-and-relationships) than generations that came before.

Lead researcher, Dr Justin Lehmiller, wrote in the report: "Gen Z and Boomers exhibited nearly identical sexual frequencies, suggesting that both the youngest and oldest adults are having the least sex.

"Also, nearly half of Gen Z reported that they were single, compared to only one-ﬁfth of Millennials, Gen X, and Boomers."

Gen Z said they had sex three times in the last month, while both millennials and Gen X got dirty five times in a month.

While Gen Z may be having less sex, they are said to be more adventurous than their older generations.

Of the study participants, 55 percent of Gen Zers said they'd discovered a new kink since joining Feeld, compared to 49 percent of Millennials, 39 percent of Gen Xers and 33 percent of Boomers.

The researchers explained: "There are at least two explanations for this.

"One is simply that older adults have had more time to learn and discover what they enjoy about sex, so they may have already uncovered their kinks.

"However, the other is that it also appears to be the case that younger adults today have a greater overall interest in kink than older adults, which may create greater openness to exploring and learning about one's kinks."

As for preferred relationship types, Gen Zers tended to favor old-fashioned monogamy (23 percent), Millennials and Gen Xers preferred ethical non-monogamy (24 percent and 27 percent respectively), while Boomers favor friends with benefits (27 percent).

## Surgeon reveals the one food you should be eating that could help prevent colon cancer

## The food can reduced the chance of colon cancer developing by nine percent

**A surgeon has lifted the lid on the one food you can eat that can help prevent colon cancer.**

Many studies have taken place over the years looking into how a particular diet can help lesser your chances of developing certain type of [cancers](https://www.unilad.com/cancer).

Heck, a [dietician has even warned](https://www.unilad.com/community/tiktok-dietitian-warning-supplements-cancer-376566-20241219) against taking some extremely common supplements that could lead to cancer.

Karan Rangarajan, more commonly known as Dr. Karan Rajan, provides [health](https://www.unilad.com/health) advice on [TikTok](https://www.unilad.com/tiktok), and he's now detailed one food to combat colon cancer.

I think we're all aware that fibre is key to gut health - something Dr. Rajan relayed in the video based on [good bacteria](https://www.unilad.com/science) in the gut providing regular bowel movements and slowing down digestion.

On top of that, there is one [food](https://www.unilad.com/food-and-drink) in particular that you should be eating that could help prevent colon cancer.

"Kiwi is particularly rich in soluble fiber, which promotes softer stool and increases stool frequency without the associated side effects of some laxatives," Dr. Rajan revealed.

Nutritionists have often said kiwi plays a key role for its anti-inflammatory effects as well as high levels of vitamin C.

All of which can protect against damage that can lead to cancer development, according to experts.

A [2023 study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10198059/) looked into the 'different types of fruit intake and colorectal cancer risk', and they found the likes of kiwi, citrus fruits, apples and watermelon decreased an individuals changes of developing colon cancer.

The results found that compared to a low intake, a higher intake of such fruits can reduce the risk of colon cancer by nine percent.

Many people will be taking notes after seeing these results as The American Cancer Society’s [estimates](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html#:~:text=The%20American%20Cancer%20Society's%20estimates,men%20and%2018%2C890%20in%20women)) that in 2024, there were 'about 106,590 new cases of colon cancer'.

The cancer is also considered the 'second most common cause of cancer deaths' in the US.

Dr Waqqas Tai, who specialises in cancer, detailed earlier this year some [symptoms that may indicate colon cancer](https://www.unilad.com/news/health/colon-cancer-symptoms-doctor-642214-20241021).

If you're going to the loo for a number two and what's coming out the other end of you is thinner than a pen or pencil, the doctor stated you should pay your doctor a visit.

"That might be a sign there is a tumor there compressing your colon causing the stool to come out thinner," Dr Tai said.

The doctor also explained how a low blood count could be a cause for concern, with the health expert turned TikToker explaining: "If you're anaemic on a complete blood count (CBC), for men, there is no healthy reason a man should be anaemic.

"Women, if you don't have heavy periods, you also should not have a low hemoglobin. And so you also need a colonoscopy."

## Cancer expert lists two things people should cut back on which could help prevent certain cancers

## Two simple dietary adjustments can help prevent certain cancers, according to the expert

**A cancer expert has listed two things people should try and cut back on which could help prevent certain cancers from developing.**

According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1,777,566 new [cancer](https://www.unilad.com/cancer) cases were reported in the [US](https://www.unilad.com/us-news) in 2021, while over 600,000 people died of the disease in the country in 2022.

While [studies](https://www.unilad.com/science) have found certain cancers are linked to family genes, there are many [health](https://www.unilad.com/health) precautions you can take every day to ensure you reduced the risk of some cancers.

Dr Jiri Kubes, a radiation oncologist and cancer expert, has suggested just two dietary adjustments could provide great health impacts, while also having a positive stance on your [mental health](https://www.unilad.com/mental-health).

![Cancer cases are at an all-time high (Getty Stock Photo)](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=1&width=3840&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/blte27a4b81ddafa3cd/67bafe62c46d61eb9aa81f18/GettyImages-2060747686.jpg)

Dr Kubes warned that completing these two health steps won't eliminate cancer, but could prevent numbers in the disease by a whopping 40 percent.

"Some of what drives cancer is outside of our control, such as genetics and age, but diet and lifestyle do play a part," the cancer specialist said.

"Processed meat and alcohol have both been named as carcinogens by the World Health Organisation. The advice is that cutting back on both of these things is better for overall health."

## Alcohol

The doctor has been speaking about how excessive [alcohol](https://www.unilad.com/alcohol) consumption can lead to an increased risk of developing liver and colon cancer.

"It is not known at which point the risks are raised, but we know the more alcohol you drink, the higher your risk," he said.

On top of reducing your chances of developing such cancers, Dr Kubes said cutting down on the booze can improve liver health.

## Processed meats

Dr Kubes has said processed meats should be consumed 'in moderation', which includes foods such as ham, sausages, and hot dogs.

![Increased alcohol consumption can lead to cancer (Getty Stock Photo)](https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=1&width=3840&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/blt40a0856635319d83/67bafef10f342e9f27268882/GettyImages-84170438-2.jpg)

"Processed meats should be eaten in moderation," the health expert said. "Along with reducing the amount of processed meat, sticking to a healthy diet rich in fruit, wholegrains and vegetables is important.

"If you are worried about your risk of any types of cancers or any symptoms, always speak to your doctor."

It comes after a [doctor warned people to 'never ignore' one cold symptom](https://www.unilad.com/news/health/doctor-warning-cough-three-weeks-082624-20250217) if it lasts for longer than three weeks.

"There is one thing I wish everyone knew about coughs - and it's really simple. If you've had a persistent cough for more than three weeks, you need to see a doctor," Dr Shireen said on TikTok.

## Doctors reveal how many times you should be able to swallow in 30 seconds to be 'healthy' and the results are shocking

## Docs conducted the largest study of its kind to test all age groups on their swallowing abilities

**If you were told to continuously swallow within 30 seconds, how well do you think you’d do at the challenge?**

A lot of us might believe that we can ace it, and probably get around 15 or more in, after all, it’s just swallowing.

But without liquids, it might be a little harder to accomplish.

Ok, so maybe we can do 10 without liquid, surely?

Mmm…You’re going to be shocked at the real answer.

According to doctors, there is a number you should be able to reach, and if not, you could have a deadly [condition](https://www.unilad.com/health).

If you find that you’re struggling to swallow when undertaking the challenge, you might have dysphagia, a condition which just means that you have ‘difficulty swallowing’.

While this isn’t deadly, it ‘is a symptom of many different medical conditions’ as per the Cleveland Clinic.

Any one of those conditions could be serious, so let’s get into the study and the results of how many times the average person should be able to swallow.

In the largest study of its kind, [docs](https://www.unilad.com/science) found the base number of swallows which means that a person is healthy, varies from age groups.

Using the [Repetitive Saliva Swallow Test](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00455-024-10702-5), which allows them to diagnose a person with dysphagia, they make a person swallow as many times as possible without the aid of [food or liquids](https://www.unilad.com/food-and-drink) for thirty seconds.

What they found was that anyone from between 20 to 39 should be able to swallow around 8.5 times in 30 seconds, those in their 40s should be able to swallow eight times, and those in their 50s should be able to complete seven swallows.

For those in their 60s, they should be able to complete just under seven swallows (6.7), those in their 70s should do six and patients in their 80s should be able be able to do just over four swallows (4.3) within the time limit.

But what if they can’t?

For those who cannot complete the number of swallows listed for their age range might have serious health problems that can cause dysphagia such as lung disease and even types of [cancers](https://www.unilad.com/cancer).

The researchers said: “This finding reinforces the necessity for a more comprehensive exploration of the validity of the established cutoff values within the oldest old age group.”

If you struggle with the test, it could indicate that you have one of these conditions: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brain tumors, cerebral palsy, dementia, multiple sclerosis (MS), parkinson’s disease, GERD, a muscle disease, or cancer.

One person who tried this out and found that [he just couldn’t swallow](https://www.unilad.com/news/tiktok/tiktoker-tests-swallowing-only-2-to-3-times-before-body-stops-446583-20240925) as he was meant to was a [TikToker](https://www.unilad.com/tiktok) called Jesse Beharrell.

He took to his page to claim that you 'can only swallow two to three times before your body forces you to stop'.

He continued: "Go on, try it, let me know how many times you can do it."

So, let’s try it.

I managed nine - sorry, Jesse.

Although, it's important to note that we shouldn't go around self-diagnosing and if you do have trouble swallowing and think it could be telling of something more, go to your doctor get checked out.
