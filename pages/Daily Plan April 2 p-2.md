25 September, 11:00 P.M. Tide told me that a girlfriend once said after the death of her husband, "God has moved me up into a more advanced class; the desks are still a little too big for me." And when we spoke about his not being there anymore and how strange it was that neither of us felt empty inside, indeed had a sense of fulfillment, Tide simply ducked her head and shrugged her shoulders and said with a brave little laugh, "Yes, the desks are still a little too big, things are bound to be a bit difficult now and then."
