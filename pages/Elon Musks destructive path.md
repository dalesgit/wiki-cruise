## Inside Elon Musk’s Gleeful Destruction of the Government

The world’s richest man has blazed a staggering trail of destruction as Trump’s DOGE chief, firing tens of thousands of workers while cashing in

B en Vizzachero had his dream job, working as a wildlife biologist with the Los Padres National Forest in California. He was moving up the ladder, had recently received a positive performance review, and was “making the world a better place,” he says. 

Yet, over Presidents’ Day weekend in February, [Donald Trump](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/donald-trump/)’s administration told Vizzachero he was being let go for his “performance.” Vizzachero was one of many thousands of “probationary” federal workers who were [baselessly fired](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/judge-trump-administration-federal-workers-jobs-back-1235295868/) by [Elon Musk](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/elon-musk/) and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency as part of Trump’s effort to purge the federal workforce and make it more MAGA.

It was crushing. “My job is my identity,” Vizzachero says. “How I’ve defined myself since I was five years old is that I love birds and bird-watching.” Talking with _Rolling Stone_ in March, following his firing, he wondered what would happen to his health insurance and whether he would need to move in with his parents. 

When a Democratic lawmaker invited Vizzachero as a guest to Trump’s joint address to Congress in March, he found himself seated near Musk. He [took the opportunity to confront](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGztzUguhvu/?igsh=MWJnaWZpNm8xeTZnaQ%3D%3D) the world’s richest man. According to Vizzachero, he described his job to Musk and asked: “Am I waste?” 

He says Musk, “with a very condescending smirk,” hit him with a line from the 1999 movie _Office Space_: “What would you say you _do_ here?”

It was a dubious callback to the scene in which a pair of management consultants interview a worker and force him to justify his job before he’s fired. Like countless Wall Street traders who took the wrong lesson from Gordon Gekko’s “greed is good” speech, Musk [missed the point](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2025/03/04/elon-musk-misunderstood-the-film-office-space-now-hes-decimating-the-federal-workforce/) of _Office Space_: that corporate culture is dehumanizing, and bosses like him are odious cretins. 

Soon after Trump’s and Republicans’ 2024 wins, which Musk supported with [$290 million](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/01/politics/elon-musk-2024-election-spending-millions/index.html) in political spending, the [Tesla](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/tesla/) CEO publicly mused about using this line from _Office Space_ on federal workers. He [posted](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1856530955709587762?lang=en) it in November on X, the social media platform he owns, with a laugh-crying emoji, resharing his earlier post of an AI-generated image in which he’s seated at a conference table behind a placard that reads “[DOGE](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/doge/).” Two weeks later, Musk [announced](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1860934910770545043?lang=en), “I rewatched _Office Space_ tonight for the 5th time to prepare for @DOGE!” The billionaire [reportedly](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/us/politics/musk-federal-bureaucracy-takeover.html) had a DOGE T-shirt made, emblazoned with his favorite line. And one weekend in February, Musk [threatened to fire](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-fire-federal-workers-who-ignore-email-1235276801/) every federal worker who failed to respond to an email asking them, “What did you do last week?”

Musk and the White House did not respond to _Rolling Stone’_s request for comment.

With DOGE, Musk has gleefully banished tens of thousands of federal employees, canceled lifesaving aid, and repeatedly threatened America’s safety-net programs, all as part of a purported hunt for waste, fraud, and abuse. He’s governed as an out-of-touch corporate villain, laughing about this carnage while partying, posting, delivering big payments to voters (although the amounts mean virtually nothing to him), and cashing in on new contracts and business opportunities — sometimes appearing high out of his mind. Even administration officials and Trump loyalists on Capitol Hill joke about the latest outrages of “Prime Minister Musk.” At every turn in his crusade of destruction, the Tesla and [SpaceX](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/spacex/) CEO has dared the courts and a weak Democratic opposition to stop him. 

But it didn’t take long for ordinary Americans to get pissed off, with protests against DOGE, Musk, and his companies erupting nationwide. “The American people are saying, you know what, Elon Musk?” says Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, a federal labor union that has brought legal challenges against the Trump administration on behalf of the more than 820,000 workers across government agencies it represents. “We’re not buying what you’re selling. We believe you to be a liar.”

Organizers have mounted a “[Tesla Takedown](https://www.teslatakedown.com/)” campaign, with tens of thousands around the globe showing up at dealerships to condemn DOGE, according to the group. They have encouraged Tesla owners to sell their cars and stockholders to dump their shares, since much of Musk’s wealth comes from his stake in the electric-vehicle manufacturer.

“People have asked, ‘What is DOGE?’ ” says a retiree at an anti-Tesla protest in Los Angeles in March, explaining that she and her husband are trying to “educate people” about the harm Musk’s pet project is causing. Passing motorists honk in support of the approximately 25 people gathered at a Tesla center despite the rain. Some hold signs denouncing Musk as a Nazi (he has [denied](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tells-joe-rogan-hes-not-a-nazi-2025-2) any association with Nazism), while another poster at the rally simply reads: “Not Sure About This Elon Guy.” 

“There is a growing movement to divest, Tesla stock is in a precipitous decline,” says actor and writer Alex Winter, who launched Tesla Takedown with other activists in February. “Things are moving in the right direction.”

## **‘Crazy Uncle Elon’**

Prior to Trump’s inauguration, observers weren’t sure how seriously to take the idea of a Musk-led government-efficiency commission, but the billionaire and DOGE have been at the vanguard of [Trump’s shockingly lawless second administration](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-musk-lawless-second-term-1235290095/). 

Musk has spearheaded the president’s purge of the federal workforce and his efforts to consolidate information and power over federal funds — despite never being elected, appointed, or confirmed to hold such a pivotal role. Musk is technically a “special government employee,” a designation that allowed him to bypass a Senate confirmation process and avoid publicly reporting his financial holdings.

DOGE was created by renaming the U.S. Digital Service and moving it under the executive office in an apparent bid to [circumvent](https://www.govexec.com/oversight/2025/03/judge-orders-doge-comply-foia-requests/403660/) public-record laws. The ethics watchdog American Oversight has sued to force the group to comply with those laws and preserve materials subject to Freedom of Information Act requests. “The public deserves to know the full extent of the damage,” said interim Executive Director Chioma Chukwu in a [statement](https://americanoversight.org/doge-suffers-another-setback-american-oversight-wins-court-order-forcing-preservation-of-records/) on an April court order requiring DOGE to fulfill this legal obligation. 

Trump and Musk have tried to grant the new office expansive authorities never envisioned by Congress, including the ability to “impound,” or freeze, funds appropriated by lawmakers. Experts say the arrangement is unconstitutional on several levels — as are DOGE’s mass firings and its attempts to shutter or pause the work of whole government agencies. A [lawsuit](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/usaid-elon-musk-doge-likely-unconstitutional-order-restoring-agency-systems.pdf) brought by personnel of the U.S. Agency for International Development ([USAID](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/usaid/)) laid out many of these arguments, contending that “Musk has acted as an officer of the United States without having been duly appointed to such a role,” and that DOGE “acted to eliminate USAID, a federal agency created by statute, where only Congress may do so.” A federal judge in Maryland agreed, [finding](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-claims-never-done-harmful-fox-interview-1235299267/) that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution as they dismantled the office. Another judge [ordered](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-probationary-workers-mass-firing-rehired/) the Trump administration to rehire thousands of probationary employees terminated by DOGE. (As of publication, the legal battle is ongoing.)

Vizzachero, the wildlife biologist, was among those rehired. The administration is still moving ahead with even larger mass firings.

> Elon Musk

Musk and his lieutenants — many [pulled from his own companies](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html), others [young techie college dropouts](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/musk-doge-techies-young-what-we-know-1235256687/) lacking in government experience — have demanded unprecedented access to sensitive personal information and government payment systems, leading to still more legal challenges. Federal judges [have](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-musk-doge-social-security-data-danger-1235300974/) [found](https://fedscoop.com/federal-judge-blocks-doge-access-to-sensitive-education-department-opm-information/) that Trump’s administration likely violated privacy and administrative laws when it gave DOGE sweeping access to personal, private data held by the [Social Security](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/social-security/) Administration, the Treasury Department, and the Education Department. Regardless, DOGE has continued to operate with the same playbook Musk used after acquiring Twitter, showing a zeal for speedy terminations and little regard for how departments function.

Throughout the chaos and confusion of Trump’s return to power, Musk also strove to cultivate the image he’s long maintained as a workhorse, showman, and expert in varied fields. He reportedly told friends he was [sleeping at DOGE offices](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-sleeping-doge-office/), rehashing claims he previously made about sleeping on a [Tesla factory floor](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-sleeping-habits-tesla-factory-floor-twitter-late-nights-2022-11). He’s continually [posted](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5290288/doge-savings-billions-contracts-musk-trump) grandiose and often inaccurate estimates of how much money DOGE has saved. 

And he seemed to relish his role as an all-powerful agitator. Musk began regularly smearing his enemies as “[retards](https://x.com/search?q=from%3A%40elonmusk%20%22retard%22&src=typed_query&f=live)” on X and [targeting judges](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/07/republicans-trump-musk-attacks-us-judges) who ruled against the administration or blocked DOGE’s incursions. He grew bold enough to [describe](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-musk-doge-social-security-system-collapse-1235286735/) Social Security, long considered untouchable, as “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.” 

Onstage at Trump’s post-inauguration event, Musk threw a [straight-armed salute](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-salute-reaction-right-wing-extremists-1235241866/) to the crowd, then responded to the ensuing backlash with a [series of puns](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/adl-elon-musk-nazi-jokes-1235244824/) on names of high-ranking Nazis from Adolf Hitler’s inner circle. Speaking virtually to the far-right German political party Alternative für Deutschland, Musk [argued](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/world/europe/musk-germany-afd-auschwitz.html) that Germany had placed “too much of a focus on past guilt.” 

At the 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Musk [waved around](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-cpac-chainsaw.html) a chain saw he said would slice through “bureaucracy” — this on the same day that his former partner Grimes publicly begged him on X to respond to her about a medical crisis experienced by one of their three children. 

“I am become meme,” he said onstage. “I’m living the meme. You know, it’s like, there’s living the dream, and there’s living the meme, and that’s pretty much what’s happening.”

The bizarre CPAC appearance prompted [speculation](https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-seemed-kinda-fed-up-at-cpac-pod-save-america-bros/) about Musk’s state of mind and recreational drug use, as he was wearing sunglasses inside and had difficulty stringing sentences together. People close to Musk have told _[The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1)_ they have known him to use illegal drugs, including LSD, cocaine, Ecstasy, and mushrooms — a source of concern for some of the board members overseeing his companies. (Musk has denied using illegal drugs, though he has spoken about his use of [prescription ketamine](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/18/tech/elon-musk-ketamine-use-don-lemon-interview/index.html), a dissociative anesthetic.)

Some senior Trump administration officials and Cabinet members have found themselves deeply annoyed by Musk. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, three people familiar with the matter say, hasn’t hidden his disdain for Musk, with some State Department officials nicknaming the Tesla billionaire “Crazy Uncle Elon,” two of those sources tell _Rolling Stone._

“I have been in the same room with Elon, and he always tries to be funny. And he’s not funny. Like, at all,” says a senior Trump administration official. “He makes these jokes and little asides and smiles and then looks almost hurt if you don’t lap up his humor. I keep using the word ‘annoying’; a lot of people who have to deal with him do. But the word doesn’t do the situation justice. Elon just thinks he’s smarter than everyone else in the room and acts like it, even when it’s clear he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.”

Musk has gnawed at the patience of an array of high-ranking administration officials, to the point that — according to this official and two others — Trump lieutenants have walked out of meetings and earnestly asked one another if they thought Musk was high. Administration officials joked to one another about subjecting Musk to mandatory drug testing, which Musk himself [has said](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/posts-mislead-musk-30-day-drug-test-ultimatum-federal-workers-2025-02-26/) would be a “great idea” for federal employees. (A lawyer for Musk has said he’s “regularly and randomly drug-tested at SpaceX and has never failed a test.”)

“Talking to the guy is sometimes like listening to really rusty nails on a chalkboard,” says the senior Trump administration official, who adds that Musk is not much of a team player, either. “He’s just the most irritating person I’ve ever had to deal with, and that is saying something.”

## **‘Why Do These Fucking Kids Know This?’**

With Trump’s blessing, Musk has engineered a climate of fear that has infected nearly every corner of the U.S. executive branch. When DOGE’s “nerd army” has moved to take over federal agencies, if their demands are not immediately met, Musk’s minions have snapped at senior government officials: [“Do I need to call Elon?”](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/musk-trump-doge-threats-nerd-army-1235267839/)

The emails that Musk has had sent to federal employees have been so intentionally dickish that several have produced an avalanche of what one Trump administration official called [“very rude”](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/elon-musk-email-spam-very-rude-1235278629/) pranks and replies. Some of these crass responses include — per messages reviewed by _Rolling Stone_ — graphic sexual images, including content involving urine and feces.

“I know Elon probably won’t see it, but I hope he sees it,” says one now-former federal employee, who says they replied to one such email with an image of a human butthole. 

Musk is apparently amused by the unrest. Aside from his public memeing, when he has privately messaged associates and confidants about reports from federal staffers about how their lives have been wrecked, the Tesla CEO has been known to react with laugh-crying emojis, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.

At the Social Security Administration, Musk and DOGE [appear to be creating](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/doge-social-security-phone-services-1235298505/) [a ticking time bomb](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-musk-doge-social-security-omalley-1235292652/) — making [big cuts](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/08/politics/social-security-administration-staff-cuts/index.html) and [changes](https://apnews.com/article/social-security-fraud-waste-doge-elon-musk-212e3089951f731fd3f83443e104b315) that may prevent some recipients from getting the benefits they are owed. 

The tech oligarch has repeatedly [warned](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/musk-misreads-social-security-data-millions-dead-people/story?id=118960821) that millions of Americans over the age of 100 are receiving benefits — a flagrant misrepresentation of agency data. Trump has [run with this falsehood](https://apnews.com/article/social-security-payments-deceased-false-claims-doge-ed2885f5769f368853ac3615b4852cf7), too, even as his acting Social Security commissioner has acknowledged that these people “are not necessarily receiving benefits.” 

Musk [has claimed](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/24/nx-s1-5337999/elon-musk-doge-social-security-cuts) there are “extreme levels of fraud” in Social Security — though he and DOGE haven’t provided any evidence. He’s argued, without basis, that [hundreds of billions in fraud](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-cuts-social-security-medicaid-medicare-1235293407/) per year are going to undocumented immigrants from entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. 

The constant griping about entitlements is making an impact: When people lose their Social Security benefits, they are [blaming](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/heres-a-dead-person-on-social-security-in-seattle-with-plenty-to-say/) [Musk](https://kfor.com/news/local/oklahoma-city-man-says-social-security-benefits-terminated-without-warning-or-explanation/) and DOGE. 

Two administration officials and another Trump adviser tell _Rolling Stone_ that when Musk has publicly decried Social Security as a “Ponzi scheme,” some close to Trump have tried to diplomatically remind Musk that this could be damaging politically.

> Senior Trump Administration Official

“We like winning elections, and you may have noticed that a lot of our voters are elderly,” the Trump adviser notes. The complaint from Trumpland brass about Musk’s inability to absorb or entertain new information is a common one.

According to the Trump adviser and an administration official, the DOGE captain has stubbornly responded with comments like, “It is a Ponzi scheme, though.” (It is not.)

As Musk and his minions claim they’re hunting for wasteful spending, the tech mogul is [vying for new contracts](https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/with-new-contracts-spacex-will-become-the-us-militarys-top-launch-provider/#:~:text=The%20breakdown%20of%20the%20military's,missions%20worth%20approximately%20%242.3%20billion) at agencies that regulate his many business interests — a situation that poses obvious conflicts of interest. The Trump White House has asserted that Musk can [police his own conflicts](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-conflict-interest-doge-1235257829/), and excuse himself from DOGE’s work overseeing certain contracts if he believes it’s necessary.

As part of their purge, Musk and DOGE fired hundreds of probationary employees at the Federal Aviation Administration, which last year [proposed fining](https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/faa-proposes-fine-spacex-633000-over-2023-launch-requirements-2024-09-17/) Musk’s SpaceX for regulatory and safety violations. Musk also [pressured](https://www.thedailybeast.com/faa-chief-michael-whitaker-quit-on-jan-20-after-elon-musk-told-him-to-resign/) the last [FAA](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/faa/) administrator to resign, leaving it without leadership when an Army helicopter and commercial jet collided over the Potomac River near D.C. in January, [killing 67 people](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/american-airlines-plane-military-helicopter-mid-air-collision-dc-deaths-1235250906/). 

The agency has started utilizing Starlink, Musk’s satellite internet service, to help upgrade the systems it uses to manage America’s airspace. Musk has tried to spin this as charity, [posting](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1895129237478162621) that “Starlink terminals are being sent at NO COST to the taxpayer on an emergency basis to restore air-traffic-control connectivity.” However, as _Rolling Stone_ has reported, FAA officials [quietly directed staff](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-starlink-faa-officials-find-funding-1235285246/) to quickly locate tens of millions of dollars to fund a Starlink deal.

_The New York Times_ separately [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/elon-musk-starlink-white-house.html) in March that Starlink is now being used on the White House campus, despite security concerns. Trump’s [Department of Defense](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/department-of-defense/) just [awarded](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-04/spacex-ula-blue-origin-win-13b-in-pentagon-launch-contracts) SpaceX billions more in contracts to put sensitive military satellites in space. DOGE is [reportedly using](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/musks-doge-using-ai-snoop-us-federal-workers-sources-say-2025-04-08/) Musk’s Grok AI chatbot liberally as it slashes the government.

Two sources with knowledge of the matter tell _Rolling Stone_ that Musk’s DOGE staffers have grilled DOD employees about the Golden Dome project, Trump’s fantastical proposal to build a space-based missile-defense system to protect the entire United States — an idea [ready-made for Starlink](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/02/elon-musk-trump-iron-dome-space-x-payday-spacex-missle-defense/). Their questions were so specific that Pentagon officials wondered if the DOGE staff had access to highly sensitive and guarded information. 

“Why do these fucking kids know this?” is how one of the sources describes their bewilderment at the time.

With DOGE, Musk has effectively infiltrated agencies that are supposed to oversee his businesses. This situation creates risk, experts say — as officials may not feel like they can scrutinize Musk’s businesses too closely. Case in point: In late February, the FAA [cleared](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/science/spacex-starship-flight-8-faa-approval/index.html) SpaceX to launch another unmanned test flight of its Starship rocket, a month after one exploded. Starship exploded again midair, raining debris over Florida and the Caribbean and [disrupting](https://www.aviationpros.com/airports/news/55275658/spacex-starship-explosions-impacted-nearly-500-flights-cost-carriers-millions) nearly 500 flights. 

The FAA’s probe of the first explosion [concluded](https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/faa-closes-investigation-into-spacex-starship-flight-7-explosion) that the probable cause was “stronger than anticipated vibrations during flight.” The agency noted that SpaceX had “implemented corrective actions” prior to launching the second rocket, which exploded too. 

## **‘Nobody Elected’ Musk**

Musk’s unprecedented attack on the government has not gone without answer from average Americans, who have mobilized mass protests focused on DOGE and Tesla. Republican lawmakers holding town-hall events have had constituents show up to berate them over Musk, [booing his name](https://www.youtube.com/live/D2i-5p4f5u8) and denouncing his cuts. By early March, House Speaker Mike Johnson [was telling](https://apnews.com/article/town-halls-musk-doge-trump-gop-749d91ea516284057e4c7bcb1615527e) his GOP colleagues to skip such events.

Demonstrations, meanwhile, spilled into the streets. “DOGE is illegitimate. Congress has not authorized them,” a federal worker at a March protest on the National Mall told _Rolling Stone_. The action saw significant support from veterans due to DOGE’s cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs. “Fuck Musk,” says another attendee, whose relative is a government contract worker. She notes that “nobody elected” Musk.

Meanwhile, a [wave of vandalism](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-targeted-by-vandalism-over-musks-right-wing-activism-2025-04-01/) — unconnected to the peaceful Tesla Takedown campaign — has seen Tesla dealerships, vehicles, and chargers [spray-painted](https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/encinitas-tesla-dealership-defaced-by-spray-painted-swastikas-profanity), [burned](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tesla-charging-stations-torched-apparent-arson-boston-latest-attack-el-rcna194692), and [damaged by gunfire](https://apnews.com/article/tesla-dealership-shooting-oregon-elon-musk-782907d226f22d5dc583d3abeefd34e2), though there have been no injuries as yet. Musk has baselessly declared that the protests are [financed by wealthy liberals](https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/03/26/tesla-protests-and-vandalism-surge-trump-backs-musk-promoted-theory-left-wing-billionaires-are-behind-protests/) and that the vandalism is “[coordinated](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1902778638824591396),” though the FBI has said there is [no evidence](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/tesla-vandalism-not-coordinated-trump-musk-claims-rcna197369) of this. 

The White House and Trump law-enforcement officials have moved to crack down on Tesla vandals. At a [Tesla showcase](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-white-house-tesla-lot-stock-1235293916/) that Trump held on the White House driveway with Musk, the president said the attackers should be considered domestic terrorists. Attorney General Pam Bondi [announced](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/tesla-arson-domestic-terrorism-pam-bondi-1235300450/) that three individuals suspected of carrying out arson attacks on Tesla properties were facing sentences of up to 20 years. The FBI launched a task force to look at anti-Tesla violence.

## **What’s $1 Million?**

Amid rising public anger about his role and influence, Musk [held a town hall](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-says-1-million-checks-get-attention-1235306650/) in late March in Green Bay, Wisconsin. More than 1,000 supporters joined him, as hundreds protested outside in the ice-cold rain. 

The protesters were there to vent their anger about Musk’s attempts to buy a state Supreme Court seat. The tech billionaire — through his Super PAC, America PAC — had been [offering](https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-supreme-court-musk-trump-b9be6119d500bdacc9c6341be013cd62) voters $100 to sign a petition decrying so-called activist judges. Only petition signers could attend the town hall. Musk had announced he would give away checks for $1 million to two event attendees. 

One protester, holding a sign that said “X-LAX needed to eliminate Musk,” told _Rolling Stone_ that Musk had “no business in Wisconsin trying to influence votes.” Another held a sign declaring, “Packer fans don’t like Nazis,” with a picture of Musk’s straight-armed salute.

Inside, Musk appeared onstage donning a Packers-style cheesehead hat before signing it and throwing it into the crowd. 

Shortly afterward, he brought two winners out to collect the $1 million checks. He [admitted to the audience](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-says-1-million-checks-get-attention-1235306650/) that the point of them is “just to get attention.” He laughed about how paying voters this way “causes the legacy media to kind of lose their minds.”

While $1 million would be a life-changing sum for most people, it means shockingly little to a man who was reportedly worth $316 billion at the end of March. One of these checks is equivalent to just over 60 cents for him, when you compare his net worth with that of the median American. (The $290 million that Musk spent to elect Trump and Republicans was equivalent to roughly $214 for him at the time — less than an average family’s [weekly grocery bill](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/01/20/average-grocery-cost-per-week-us-states/72260684007/).)

At his town hall, Musk — an immigrant — launched into a tirade about noncitizens receiving Social Security numbers, standing in front of a chart purporting to show a big spike under Democrats. In reality, legal immigrants are given Social Security numbers so they can pay taxes; this process was in fact [made automatic](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/musk-trump-immigrants-social-security-numbers-1235307351/) during Trump’s first term. The crowd gasped as Musk gave them the false impression that DOGE had finally found real fraud in Social Security. 

When Musk was interrupted by protesters, he joked that they were operatives funded by Democratic mega-donor George Soros — yes, inside the event filled with people he was paying $100 to sign his petition, where he also gave away $2 million. 

Throughout the night, Musk argued that the Wisconsin Supreme Court election would have major implications not just for the state or the country, but possibly the world — if Democrats won, he argued, Republicans could lose two congressional seats. 

Two days later, Wisconsin voters convincingly rejected Musk’s candidate, Brad Schimel, by 10 points. The election was a referendum on Musk — and he lost big. 

Dr. Kristin Lyerly, a Wisconsin OB-GYN who serves on the board for the Committee to Protect Health Care and campaigned against Schimel, tells _Rolling Stone,_ “Authenticity is incredibly important to Wisconsinites, and that is what Elon Musk completely lacked: any sense of authenticity.” 

After Musk’s epic fail, word trickled out that he could soon leave the Trump administration. It wasn’t a surprise — special government employees are supposed to serve for 130 days or less per year. Musk’s effect on the government and its workers will linger. 

On April 5, as a wave of “Hands Off!” protests coalesced against Trump and Musk in every state and cities around the world, _Rolling Stone_ spoke again with Vizzachero. He was getting ready to speak at one of these rallies in California. (Now that he’s been rehired, he says, “the statements that I’m making to you are my personal opinions.”)

He reads his planned speech over the phone. He talks about how environmental and conservation laws brought back the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon, and restored America’s public lands. “The Trump administration wants to exploit and abuse our public lands so that they can make billionaires like Elon Musk even richer,” he says.

It’s been a month since his run-in with Musk. He says he’s “kind of grateful.”

If he saw Musk again now, Vizzachero says, “I would thank him for radicalizing me, because I had actually never attended a protest until a week after I got fired. I spent a long time sitting on the sidelines thinking there’s so much bad stuff happening. He gave me the push that I needed to use my voice to speak up and speak out.”
