# Trump tariffs based on massive error, conservative think tank AEI says

The [formula](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/03/how-trump-calculated-tariffs-trade-deficit) used by the Trump administration to levy reciprocal tariffs contains a serious math error that over-inflates the impact by about a factor of four, economists at the American Enterprise Institute said.

**Why it matters:** The conservative think tank says the error led to tariff rates massively higher than they should have been to achieve the goals the administration sought.

**Catch up quick:** After announcing the tariffs last Wednesday the Trump administration released a [complicated-looking formula](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-formula-calculated), which it said was developed with the Council of Economic Advisers, used to determine how to set the rates.

-   It turns out the formula is simply the U.S. trade deficit with each country, divided by the value of the goods the U.S. imports from that country.
-   Two other variables in the equation cancel each other out, rendering them effectively meaningless.

**Yes, but:** AEI's economists Kevin Corinth and Stan Veuger [say](https://www.aei.org/economics/president-trumps-tariff-formula-makes-no-economic-sense-its-also-based-on-an-error/) they shouldn't cancel each other out, because Trump's team used the wrong level for one of them.

**How it works:** One of the variables relates to the "elasticity of import prices with respect to tariffs," which is to say, how much import prices move as tariffs are applied.

-   The administration's calculation assigns a value of 0.25 to that variable, which in the math of price elasticity suggests most of the tariff impact does _not_ hit the import price of an item as it enters the country.
-   But the AEI paper says they used the wrong value for _import prices_, and instead used the value for a _retail price,_ or what happens to the final consumer price after the good is imported and distributed.
-   They argue, instead, that the right value is 0.945 — in other words, almost all of the tariff hits the import price of a good as it's brought into the country.
-   "It is inconsistent to multiply the elasticity of import demand with respect to _import_ prices by the elasticity of _retail_ prices with respect to tariffs," the authors write.

**For example:** Corinth and Veuger write that if the tariffs had been calculated correctly, with the same ultimate goals in mind but using the right kind of elasticity figure, the levy on a country like Vietnam would have been 12.2% and not 46%.

**The intrigue:** In making the case for their approach, including their formula, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative [cites](https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/reciprocal-tariff-calculations) research on price elasticity by the Harvard Business School professor Alberto Cavallo.

-   Cavallo himself [says](https://x.com/albertocavallo/status/1907974351967633570) it's not clear the USTR used his findings properly.

**For the record:** The White House did not immediately return a request for comment on AEI's assertion.

**The bottom line: "**Now, our view is that the formula the administration relied on has no foundation in either economic theory or trade law," Corinth and Veuger write.

-   "But if we are going to pretend that it is a sound basis for US trade policy, we should at least be allowed to expect that the relevant White House officials do their calculations carefully."
