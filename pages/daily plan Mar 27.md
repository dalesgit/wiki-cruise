Reflection
I’m grateful for:
Mark and Jenine. #names Gentle thoughtful. Life experience. Recognizable and poignant. 

What I did well today: #grateful 
Exercise. Shepherd my inner energy. 
The conversation with Roger / Patrick esp. at dinner was natural and touched on deep matters. Patrick talked about his life in South Africa in a way he hadn’t before.
I can’t express the joy I feel in the presence of the piano players Rachel and Taylor.. They are a blessing. She dedicated a song to her sister whose birthday it is/was. Taylor recorded it for sending to her. She is 12 years older. As a teenager her sister played guitar and became the inspiration for Rachel to be a musician. She said she had perhaps not told her that before.

What I’ve learned today:
The prayer can be a focus or an archery target — darts target for life in this environment.
Realistic target. A trip around Australia like our trip around Europe. Points. Train.
