*   Verdin believes that lifestyle factors have a greater impact on lifespan than genes.

A [healthy aging doctor](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-doctor-reversed-biological-age-15-years-eats-avoids-mediterranean-2025-3) and researcher who says he has reversed his biological age by around 15 years shared the breakfast that helps him avoid blood sugar spikes.

"The worst breakfast you can possibly imagine is your sort of cereal bowl with a glass of orange juice because this is essentially a bowl of sugar, sugar, sugar," Dr. Eric Verdin, the CEO and president of the [Buck Institute for Research on Aging](https://www.businessinsider.com/keto-drink-for-longevity-and-aging-being-tested-across-us-2024-10), said.

[High blood sugar](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/hyperglycemia) is linked to metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, and some longevity experts believe that added sugars play a role in the aging process.

Verdin is 68, but after "optimizing" his health for the past decade, by making diet and lifestyle tweaks, he said that his "biological age" is much younger, based on various epigenetic blood tests**.**

(Note: There's no consensus on the [definition of biological age](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-maximum-age-of-humans-115-or-older-2023-3) or how to measure it; Verdin uses GlycanAge and SuPar, which use inflammation markers to measure aging.)

He also uses [wearable tech](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/fitness-wearables-trackers-pros-cons-wellness-experts-2024-1), such as the Whoop smartwatch, to keep tabs on his blood pressure and cholesterol, and makes lifestyle changes accordingly.

Based on his results, Verdin believes that diet has a huge impact on longevity. He follows a [Mediterranean-style diet](https://www.businessinsider.com/chef-grew-up-mediterranean-diet-tricks-add-fiber-meals-2025-2) that includes lots of fresh produce, legumes, whole grains, and lean proteins, and avoids ultra-processed foods. "When you look at populations that are on this type of diet, they really are the healthy ones," Verdin said.

Why a sweet breakfast is bad for longevity
------------------------------------------

"Breakfast should be savory. So no pastries, no orange juice, no fruity yogurt," Verdin said.

Eating a sugary or high-carb meal on an empty stomach can cause your blood sugar to spike, he said.

"What it does, it sets you up for the whole day of bouncing up and down with your blood sugar," which means you're likely going to experience energy crashes and cravings throughout the day, he said.

A [rise in blood sugar after eating carbs](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-eat-carbs-without-blood-sugar-spikes-2024-9) is natural and not necessarily a problem. However, having [chronic high blood sugar](https://www.businessinsider.com/5-warning-signs-you-might-have-high-blood-sugar-doctors-2024-9) can increase inflammation over time, aging your body and raising your risk of chronic disease.

Start the day with fiber, protein, and good fats
------------------------------------------------

Verdin typically eats eggs, avocado, and salmon (either smoked or cooked) with wholemeal bread for breakfast.

He's not particularly fussed about how his eggs are cooked, but prefers to use olive oil over butter. "If one prefers no oil, hard boiled would be the best method," he said.

Eggs and salmon both contain healthy fats and protein, which help you feel full throughout the day. Wholemeal bread and avocado add fiber to the meal, which is important for digestive health as it feeds the "good" bacteria in the gut.
