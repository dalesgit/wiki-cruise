# Artificial Intelligence Solves One of Archaeology’s Greatest Puzzles

> ## Excerpt
> AI is unlocking the secrets of the Nazca Lines, revealing 303 new geoglyphs in just six months and reshaping the future of archaeology.

---
For over a century, the **Nazca Lines** in Peru have puzzled archaeologists. These massive geoglyphs, created by the Nazca people between **200 BC and 650 AD**, cover vast areas of desert, depicting animals, plants, and tools. Many of these intricate designs, only visible from the sky, have long eluded full understanding.

Now, a collaboration between archaeologists and artificial intelligence (AI) has uncovered 303 new geoglyphs in just six months, doubling the known total. This breakthrough, made possible by AI, has provided fresh insights into the purpose of the lines, which were long debated. As reported by _[Science Focus](https://www.sciencefocus.com/planet-earth/how-were-about-to-solve-the-worlds-greatest-archaeological-puzzle)_, this discovery marks a significant leap forward in solving one of archaeology’s greatest puzzles.

## The Power of AI in Archaeology

Researchers, including [**Prof. Masato Sakai** from **Yamagata University’s Institute of Nazca**](https://yudb.kj.yamagata-u.ac.jp/html/273_en.html) in Peru, have partnered with **IBM scientists** to teach AI how to analyze massive swathes of aerial imagery, identifying previously hidden geoglyphs. This collaboration has significantly accelerated the process, making it possible to conduct surveys in a fraction of the time it would normally take. As Sakai explains, “The ability to conduct the \[survey\] in such a short period was thanks to the use of AI.”

AI is not only helping to identify more geoglyphs but also changing how archaeologists approach the study of ancient civilizations. By processing **aerial imagery**, AI can spot patterns that might have otherwise gone unnoticed by the human eye, offering a more **efficient** and **precise** way to map and understand historical remains.

The success of AI in the Nazca Desert is only the beginning, as the technology is already being applied to other archaeological sites across the world, from **burial mounds** to [shipwrecks](https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/250-treasure-laden-shipwrecks-22-tons-gold/).

## Revolutionizing the Study of Ancient Civilizations

The Nazca Lines represent one of the first successful uses of AI in archaeology. The lines, which were created by scraping away the top layer of soil to expose lighter-colored material underneath, are intricate and precise, showcasing the Nazca people’s advanced understanding of geometry and proportion.

**Maria Reiche**, a German mathematician and astronomer, spent decades studying the lines, noting their “perfect” proportions. Now, AI is helping us uncover even more of these designs, shedding light on their possible meanings and functions.

Historically, archaeologists relied on traditional methods such as ground surveys, photography, and manual mapping to study these ancient sites. However, as **Dr. João Fonte**, an archaeologist with ERA Arqueologia, points out, “Archaeology is really at the forefront of innovation” in terms of adopting digital tools.

In addition to AI, archaeologists are now using photogrammetry and remote sensing technologies, allowing them to study vast areas more quickly and with greater accuracy.

### New Insights into the Nazca Lines’ Purpose

One of the most intriguing aspects of this AI-driven discovery is the potential to better understand the purpose of the Nazca Lines. Sakai’s team suggests that many of the **new geoglyphs** were part of **ritual walkways**, where individuals would walk along the lines to engage with the landscape and **commune with the gods**. AI’s ability to identify these new sites has helped confirm that the geoglyphs were designed not only as **artistic expressions** but also as **spiritual and cultural symbols**.

The AI system’s ability to **process large datasets** and identify geoglyphs that may have previously gone unnoticed opens up new possibilities for understanding the Nazca civilization’s connection to their environment, as well as their advanced knowledge of spatial design and astronomy.

## The Future of AI in Archaeology

While AI has already revolutionized the study of the Nazca Lines, the technology has vast potential for the future of archaeology. **Dr. Alexandra Karamitrou**, an **AI and archaeology expert** at the **University of Southampton**, is developing tools that could help archaeologists identify a wider range of historical sites.

Her work demonstrates that AI can not only detect visible features like geoglyphs but also **interpret complex relationships** between these sites and other environmental factors, such as their proximity to water or their position on a hill slope.

The applications of AI in archaeology extend beyond geoglyphs and ancient art. **In 2023**, researchers from the **United Arab Emirates** used AI to analyze satellite data from the **Saruq Al Hadid** site, a **copper smelting center** from 1270-800 BC.

AI provided insights into the distribution of artefacts and helped archaeologists prioritize excavation efforts. This technology could also assist in studying **sunken shipwrecks**, **buried cities**, and even **climate change** impacts on ancient sites.

## The Risks and Limitations of AI in Archaeology

Despite the promising results, AI is not infallible. **Sakai’s team** had to manually verify AI’s predictions, scrutinizing dozens of suggestions for each new geoglyph. **“AI isn’t perfect, especially in archaeology,”** says **Dr. Karamitrou**. “But in a few years’ time we might be able to develop algorithms with very good accuracy… helping people save time, energy, and money.”

As AI technology improves, it is expected to become even more **accurate**, allowing archaeologists to explore more areas with fewer resources. The ability to **automate the detection of sites** could drastically increase the speed and scope of archaeological research, uncovering hidden treasures and unlocking the secrets of ancient civilizations.
