Rep. [Don Bacon](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/24/atlantic-yemen-signal-hegseth-jeffrey-goldberg) (R-Neb.) slammed the decision to fire [Gen. Timothy Haugh](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/04/nsa-director-timothy-haugh-fired-trump-demcorats), the National Security Agency director and head of U.S. Cyber Command, without any explanation as "heartbreaking" Sunday.

**The big picture:** Haugh, along with his civilian deputy Wendy Noble, was fired Thursday, the same day that several members of President [Trump's](https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump) embattled [National Security Council](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/03/trump-laura-loomer-fire-national-security-council) were ousted.

-   Their firings followed conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer's Oval Office visit, where she pressed Trump to fire specific NSC staffers, Axios previously reported.
-   Trump denied to reporters on Air Force One Thursday that Loomer had anything to do with the firings but said "she makes recommendations ... and sometimes I listen to those recommendations."
-   Loomer on Friday [wrote](https://x.com/lauraloomer/status/1908013350866608261?s=46) that Haugh and Noble had "been disloyal to President Trump" and "\[t\]hat is why they have been fired."

**Driving the news:** The decision to boot Haugh "puts us back," Bacon, a member of the Armed Services Committee and a former Air Force brigadier general, said on CBS News' "Face the Nation." "It hurts us."

-   He continued, "Russia and China are laughing at us today because we just fired the absolute best leaders."

**What's next:** Asked if there would be hearings on reporting that the firings came after Loomer, [a far-right activist](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/13/laura-loomer-conspiracy-theories-trump) who has frequented Mar-a-Lago, met with Trump, Bacon said he's sure there will be "some oversight."

-   As the chairman of the Cyber, Information Technologies, and Innovation Subcommittee, Bacon said he would "guarantee" the panel would have questions for military leaders and Defense Secretary [Pete Hegseth](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/26/pete-hegseth-michael-waltz-congress-resign-fired).
-   He predicted administration officials would defend the decision as "the president's right." But he added, "He may have the constitutional authority to do it, but it doesn't make it right."

-   Bacon continued, "We have an opportunity to probe into this and ask why. And I have a responsibility to make clear this was wrong ... it hurt our country."

**Between the lines:** Bacon has broken with the administration and party members on several recent policy debates, including on its [approach to Russia](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/31/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-war-don-bacon), sweeping [tariffs](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/04/house-republican-plans-bill-to-let-congress-block-trump-tariffs) and the proposed [impeachment of federal judges](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/19/donald-trump-impeach-judges-republicans-congress).

-   Loomer's presence in Trump's circle has led GOP lawmakers, even close Trump allies, to [sound alarms](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/13/trump-allies-far-right-activist-loomer) in the past. That friction was present during the 2024 campaign after she shared a racist post about former Vice President Kamala Harris.

Top congressional Democrats on Thursday night spoke out over reports that [Gen. Timothy Haugh](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/13/elon-musk-national-security-agency-visit) has been fired as National Security Agency director.

**The big picture:** The Washington Post first [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/03/nsa-director-fired-tim-haugh/) that Haugh had been removed from the NSA role and as U.S. Cyber Command chief, along with his civilian deputy Wendy Noble, citing a former U.S. official and two current ones.

Members of [Congress](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/21/democrats-house-senate-tea-party-trump) in both parties exploded in anger Monday after the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic [revealed](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/) he was inadvertently included in a highly sensitive Trump administration Signal chat on airstrikes in Yemen.

**Why it matters:** Some Democrats are already calling for an investigation and potential repercussions against the national security officials involved in the lapse.
