# Rare birds make way for hypersonic rockets on Hawaiian refuge

> ## Excerpt
> The US government is reclaiming space on the Johnston national wildlife refuge for SpaceX landing pads

The US military is planning to transform a rare bird sanctuary in Hawaii into a landing site for SpaceX hypersonic rocket tests.

The Space Force agency issued a notice last month of its intent to construct two landing pads at the Johnston national wildlife refuge, an atoll 700 nautical miles from Honolulu.

The Rocket Cargo Vanguard programme would involve the landing of ten [SpaceX](https://www.thetimes.com/topic/spacex) rockets a year over the next four years as part of a larger military operation aimed at advancing the use of commercial rockets for the defence department.

Biologists worry that noise pollution and hazardous debris from the rockets, which can deliver 100 tons of cargo anywhere on the planet within 90 minutes, could disturb the wildlife and jeopardise decades of restoration efforts. The atoll is home to more than 1.5 million birds of 15 different species, including nearly half of the world’s red-tailed tropicbirds.

“Installing rocket landing pads on Johnston atoll cannot occur without significantly disrupting wildlife and harming the important bird colonies found there,” Michael Parr, president of the American Bird Conservancy, said. “Decades of US conservation investment have made this a crucial nesting haven for many seabirds, which are among the fastest-declining and most endangered groups of birds worldwide.”

The air force said it had consulted the Fish and Wildlife Service about the implications of the programme on the local wildlife and potential measures to avoid or mitigate environmental impacts. The Times has contacted SpaceX for comment.

Last year, an [environmental group sued Elon Musk’s company](https://www.thetimes.com/article/a5c2a22b-e89f-43ad-85f8-3ac311de01a6) over claims the SpaceX Starship launch at a site in Boca Chica, Texas, had caused explosions, fires and leaks in state parks and endangered bird and sea turtle refuges. The lawsuit was dropped in February.

At the time, Musk joked that he would give up omelettes for a week to make up for the “heinous crime” of destroying bird nests.

The Johnston atoll was named a national wildlife refuge in 2004 after it was decommissioned as a military installation. It was designated a national monument of the Pacific Remote Island Marine in 2009, with colonies of Pacific birds reclaiming its entire runway.

“Johnston atoll is one of the few bright spots around the world where seabird populations have actually been increasing,” Brad Keitt, the ocean director at the conservancy, said. “While numbers on Johnston are going up, seabird populations globally have declined by more than 70 per cent since 1950. Seabirds need undisturbed islands without invasive predators to breed, and there simply are not that many places like this remaining in the world.”

The Rocket Cargo program is part of a $102 million contract the Air Force awarded to SpaceX in 2022. The Space Force is expected to submit an environmental assessment for public review in the coming months.
