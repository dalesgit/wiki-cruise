Magnesium is a vital mineral that supports over 300 bodily functions. From improving mood to sleep, exercise performance, and regulating blood sugar, magnesium plays a crucial role for our body and brain.  
Magnesium is found naturally in a variety of foods, such as leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and beans. However, if your diet lacks magnesium, taking magnesium supplements can offer these health benefits. In rare cases, even if an individual has a balanced diet, magnesium deficiency could happen, especially in people with digestive disorders, such as celiac disease and chronic diarrhea. Certain medications, such as diuretics (water pills) and antibiotics, can lower blood magnesium levels. That's when magnesium supplements become a necessity.  
There are numerous types of magnesium supplements available on the market, with each having its own targeted benefits. So getting the right

is important. Also, it is crucial to know the right time to take it to maximize the benefits.

Depending on its benefits, there are numerous magnesium supplements available in the market. But identifying the right supplements is crucial for your health.  
Dr. Saurabh Sethi, Board-certified gastroenterologist, trained at Harvard and Stanford, has shared four best and worst magnesium supplements, based on his clinical experience and research.  
According to him, the best magnesium supplement for sleep is magnesium glycinate. Magnesium glycinate is known for its calming effects and is ideal for those struggling with anxiety, poor sleep, or frequent muscle cramps. This form is highly bioavailable and gentle on the digestive system.  
“The best magnesium to use for mental clarity and function is

Magnesium L-threonate

, as it crosses the blood-brain barrier,” Dr. Sethi says. This supplement is known for its brain-boosting properties. It is especially effective for cognitive and neurological health.

If you are struggling with constipation, the gastroenterologist recommends magnesium citrate. It is a popular choice to relieve constipation due to its mild laxative effect. It offers good absorption and a lower cost. It is also effective for general supplementation. “In fact, as a gastroenterologist, I use it routinely in my practice for colonoscopy preparations, but the important thing to know is that all of these 3 forms of magnesium will raise magnesium levels in the blood,” the doctor adds. One magnesium supplement he asks to avoid is magnesium oxide, as “it does not get absorbed very well.”

The right time to take the supplement really matters if you want to reap maximum benefits. But the timing depends on the supplement’s purpose.  
For instance, if you want sleep or relaxation, taking magnesium glycinate or L-threonate 30-60 minutes before bed is the best. To achieve constipation relief, magnesium citrate works best in the morning or early afternoon. If energy or muscle recovery is the goal, taking the supplementation in the morning or post-workout is ideal.
