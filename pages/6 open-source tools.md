# 6 free and open-source apps you actually haven't heard of

> ## Excerpt
> Open-source and free apps can do things you might not even think of, so here are a few examples of great ones.

---
So let's talk about it: here are some great free and open-source apps — and for this article, we're talking about ones you've almost certainly never used. There's also a lot of self-hosted software on this list, so these are fun projects to set up in the first place.

## 6 Mixxx

### The name may be misleading

Despite what the use of the triple X may suggest, Mixxx is simply a music-making app; or more specifically, a DJ mixing app. Now, as you can probably guess, I'm not a musician, but Mixxx appears to be a very capable platform. It starts out by importing your music library (which you can point it to), so you can easily start adding tracks and mixing them together as needed.

You can then add all kinds of instruments, including multiple microphones and other dedicated hardware that allows you to create increasingly complex tracks. It also has built-in recording so you can record your mixes for publishing, or you can link up a dedicated streaming service to share your work online in real time.

## 5 Persepolis

### A download manager that makes your life easier

Most people might not even think they need a download manager, but Persepolis is a fantastic app that shows exactly why you might want to have one. This cross-platform download manager runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows (where I did most of my testing), and it offers a lot of features you might not have even considered you need. You can easily find and queue multiple downloads and start them whenever you're ready. Not only does Persepolis parse typical download links, but you can point to locations such as YouTube to download videos, too, so this is already a huge feature to have.

But aside from the ability to manually pause and start downloads so you can handle them later, Persepolis has a proper scheduling function so you can choose when downloads should start and end, including the ability to force your PC to stay awake to finish the downloads. Persepolis can also import multiple download links in one go using a text file, so if there's a set of apps you always install on a PC,m, for example, you can have a text file with all the URLs you need and fire off all the downloads in one go.

## 4 Pairdrop

-       ![Screenshot of PairDrop showing two available devices to share with over the network](https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/pairdrop-1.png)

Sharing files locally is something you might not even think of doing in the age of the internet and cloud storage, but there are still apps out there that allow you to do just that, and PairDrop is one of them. PairDrop is available on the web as a standard website, but if you want to be even more local, you can also self-host a PairDrop server. You can send pretty much any kind of file over PairDrop, and even send text messages to other devices.

There isn't much of a difference between the self-hosted and online implementations, aside from the fact that your devices won't be discoverable outside your network if you're using a local server, even using a link or group code. Of course, self-hosting always has more of a sense of accomplishment and an extra layer of privacy, so it's a fun option to try if you're feeling so inclined.

## 3 Ntfy

### Notifications for everything

    ![Screenshot of the Ntfy configuration page showing the dialog for creating a notification service](https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/ntfy-notifications.png)

When you start playing around with smart homes and a lot of self-hosted services, one of the things that can come in handy is setting up notifications for various kinds of events. For example, if you use a monitoring tool like Uptime Kuma, you can set up notifications for important events regarding the services you're monitoring.

    ![Screenshot of a notification sent by Ntfy on an Android phone](https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/ntfy-notification-on-phone.jpg)

Ntfy is a conceptually simple but very capable notification service that can basically integrate with almost any service that uses HTTP notifications so that you can receive these notifications on your phone. This makes it that much easier to keep up with all the information you care about from sensors and services that you choose to connect, even if you're not on your main PC or away from home.

## 2 Vert

### A file conversion tool that's all yours, on any device

-       ![Screenshot of Vert homepage showing the option to upload a file for conversion](https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/vert-sh-1.png)

This image, video, and audio converter is available on the web, but the source code is publicly available, and even better, you can host it yourself on your own server if you don't want to have to rely on the internet. Actually, the standard web version already converts audio, images, and documents locally on your device, but if you want absolute privacy for converting your videos, the self-hosted approach is perfect for you.

A ton of formats are supported for conversion, so you can create a file that works pretty much anywhere. On top of that, Vert has no limits on file size or paywalls, something you can't say about a lot of free online conversion tools. This one is definitely worth checking out.

## 1 KitchenOwl

### Your personal, private cookbook

-       ![Screenshot of the shopping list in KitchenOwl](https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/05/kitchenowl-1-1.png)

That's not even all of it, either. KitchenOwl also includes meal planning so those with busier lives can plan ahead and know what to eat and when so there's no stress thinking about it every day. Plus, there's an expense tracker built-in, which you can use for basically anything you want, not just food. It's a great home management solution, and having it hosted on your personal server makes total sense, though KitchenOwl also operates as a web-based tool if you want to go that route.

### Start exploring open-source apps

These are just a few of the many open-source apps out there that you (or even I) have never heard of and that are worth checking out. While I'm not personally going to need some of these, others definitely get my interest directly. KitchenOwl and PairDrop are probably apps I'm going to keep loaded on my NAS going forward, and I can fully see Vert staying there, too. I recommend checking these out if you'd like to try out some new apps that can greatly enhance your digital life.
