Am I correct in understanding that the Maui listening session will be conducted after the profile comes out?

I'm hoping that the Search Committee in developing the profile will be able to articulate a vision for this Diocese that will resonate with its people, address the question of what God is calling us to do and be in these times.

It will also change the number of delegates from each congregation, correct?
