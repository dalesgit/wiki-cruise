## Corcoran bringing down New College

Once again, New College President Richard Corcoran demonstrates he is woefully incompetent.  

With Corcoran at the helm in December 2024, New College hired Frederick Piccolo Jr. as director of marketing and media.

![Frederick Piccolo Jr.](https://www.heraldtribune.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/16/NSHT/83120606007-fred-piccolo-jr.jpg?width=300&height=375&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp)

Piccolo already had been charged three times with indecent exposure, according to the Sarasota Clerk of the Court Records public website.

After [he was accused of committing a similar crime again recently](https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/local/2025/04/16/former-desantis-spokesperson-arrested-in-mformer-desantis-spokesperson-arrested-in-manatee-county-fo/83119400007/), New College’s sadly deficient vetting process for new employees was exposed.

Corcoran can barely keep his head above water and continues to diminish the reputation of the Sarasota college with: 

-   plunging college national rankings by U.S. News & World Report; 
-   plummeting SAT scores of incoming students to lowest levels ever;
-   nosediving percentage of students who graduate.

Yet New College spends more per student than any other public university in the state of Florida.  Under Corcoran’s administration the motto is: "Pay more, get less!"

The thought of [giving Corcoran oversight of Ringling Museum and the USF Sarasota-Manatee campus,](https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/education/2025/02/04/new-college-could-take-over-ringling-museum-from-florida-state/78209886007/) handing him the opportunity to destroy other high-quality institutions, is nonsensical, appalling and reckless.

The citizens of Sarasota and the entire state of Florida must demand that their state legislators use common sense and oppose this cockamamie scheme.

![During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, Florida's surgeon general, said no one under 50 should get the vaccine, while Dr. Anthony Facci recommended lockdowns and mandatory vaccinations.](https://www.heraldtribune.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/24/NSHT/83251964007-ladapo-speaks-against-water-fluoridation-at-bartow-city-commis-workshop-feb-18-ernst-peters-ledger.jpg?width=660&height=440&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp)

## Letter wrong: Ladapo’s COVID advice right

The [April 22 Herald-Tribune had a letter](https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/opinion/letters/2025/04/19/fauci-vaccine-covid-ladapo-letters/83146763007/) touting Dr. Anthony Fauci and criticizing Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo (“Fauci speaks truth; Ladapo spreads untruth”).

Fauci’s COVID-19 guidance was erroneous on several occasions. 

Early in the pandemic Fauci advised remdesivir as the only approved treatment; however, remdesivir treatments had to be quickly completely halted due to severe kidney damage in a significant percentage of cases. 

Fauci also advised lockdowns and mandatory vaccines.

Lockdowns accomplished nothing but financial hardships and mandatory vaccines were abandoned.  People lost jobs for noncompliance in taking a vaccine that did not prevent getting COVID or transmitting it.

Fauci later admitted in a medical journal, [Cell Host & Microbe](https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(22)00572-8), the “COVID vaccine was a disappointment as are all respiratory mucosal vaccines.”

[Ladapo](https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/nation/2024/01/04/florida-surgeon-general-dr-joseph-ladapo-covid-vaccine/72107931007/), who has a Harvard M.D. and Ph.D. – and is a board-certified internist – was right on in advising no one under 50 should get the vax.

Former President Joe Biden saw fit to [preemptively pardon Fauci](https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/20/biden-pardons-milley-fauci-cheney-schiff/76823846007/) as he left office.

## Pope Francis built a church open to all

Pope Francis was the “People’s Pope.”

His papacy was marked by a deep commitment to the poor, to ecological justice, to interreligious dialogue and to the full dignity of all people – including LGBTQ+ Catholics, [refugees](https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/world/2025/04/21/pope-francis-immigration-legacy/83193937007/) and those historically excluded from full participation in the church. 

He opened doors long closed in church tradition, including the possibility of female deacons.

Pope Francis, who died April 21, embodied a “theology of encounter” – one that echoes the ministry of Jesus – drawing near to the wounded, the overlooked and the oppressed.

May his legacy of building a church where all voices are heard, all vocations are honored and no one is left behind continue to flourish in the next papacy.

## Liberals using freedom to gain power

Both conservative ideology and liberal ideology realize that inequities and injustices exist in every segment of society today. Both ideologies envision a better world.   

The difference between the two platforms is that liberals believe the problems will be best solved by government solutions and conservatives believe individual freedom and the free market are the better solutions.  

History has demonstrated (Soviet Union, North Korea, Iran, China, Roman Empire, Cuba, etc.) that government is wasteful and serves the elite rather than the populace. 

Socialism and communism have repeatedly stifled creativity and destroyed individual motivation. 

The U.S. Constitution produced the best system of government in history. However, the benefits of individual freedom can only be maintained by a population grounded in integrity and spirituality. 

The U.S. has lost its moral compass.

The freedom created by our Constitution is being used by liberals to undermine our government system; chaos is the result. 

Liberals are using constitutional freedom to obtain power and control of our government.

Common sense is what is needed for the U.S. to continue to succeed.

Unfortunately, it is very apparent that liberals are more interested in their power than the American people.

## Don't cater to Russia

As a child growing up in the 1950s, we were told to fear Russia. 

We had practice drills, crouching under our desks at school in case we were bombed. 

As time moved on Russia lost much of its power and territory, but it has never been our friend. I do not understand the current favoritism the United States appears to be giving to Russian President Vladimir Putin in both trade and peace negotiations. 

Russia is one of the only countries on which we are not imposing a tariff.

The U.S. is withholding some approved aid to Ukraine until it shows sincere efforts toward peace. Ukraine has done so, but the aid is still not totally flowing – and Russia has violated a ceasefire.

I heard one explanation for the favoritism was because the U.S. had mistreated Putin over allegations of interference in our elections. Those allegations were proven, and 26 Russian citizens and three Russian companies were indicted. 

The sanctions that were imposed on Russia were consequences of the country’s actions.

I am asking the White House to free up the funding to Ukraine, put equal tariffs on Russia as any equivalent trade partner and get a defense secretary who has experience running/commanding a major department/senior command structure.

## Trump seeks control of law firms

Well, it seems that President Donald Trump and his dubious cohorts are now legitimizing extortion.

[Trump has threatened law firms](https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/05/trump-executive-orders-law-firms-legal-system/82660074007/) and famous universities by demanding what I call “kickbacks” if they do not capitulate to his selfish demands.

I feel our fragile democracy is crumbling under the insidious behavior of the current administration.

Glad to see Harvard is standing up to the bully in the Oval Office.
