Owen,

Such alarming news about you and Emelia. I gather you are on the mend and on your way to finding a solution for Emelia. We are at this moment in Fiji. A long ways away from the events unfolding in the US. And yet the slow-motion catastrophe of the dismemberment of our nation is ever-present in our awareness. 

As to our contribution to the trust, we will be on US soil in a week (Hilo). A couple of questions: 

1. What is an ACH transfer? Is there a convenient way -- other than USPS -- to get the money to you?
2. We had in mind a contribution of something like $4,000, though it is a bit of a gulp to recognize that we have lost over $50,000 in the past month. Is it possible that you have an idea of how close you are to meeting your/our goal? 
3. Do you have any information about how Lee Corum has fared with the government slash and burn?

Hold onto your limbs and thank you for your dedication to helping Emma.
