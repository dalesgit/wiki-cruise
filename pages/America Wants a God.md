Today, we’re introducing “Believing,” a yearlong exploration from The Times on how we experience religion and spirituality now.

Americans believe.

Most people are wary of the government, the future and even [each other](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/07/22/key-findings-about-americans-declining-trust-in-government-and-each-other/), but they still believe in astonishing possibilities. Almost all Americans — 92 percent of adults — say they have a spiritual belief, in a god, human souls or spirits, an afterlife or something “beyond the natural world,” as [we reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/briefing/one-nation-under-god.html) earlier this year.

The country seems to be acknowledging this widespread spiritual hunger. America’s secularization is on pause, people have stopped leaving churches, and religion is taking a more prominent role in public life — in the [White House](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/politics/white-house-prayers.html), [Silicon Valley](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/business/silicon-valley-christianity.html), [Hollywood](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2025/04/13/white-lotus-monologue-women-friendship-feminism/82996515007/) and even at [Harvard](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/style/religion-america.html). It’s a major, generational shift. But what does this actually look like in people’s lives?

I have spent the past year reporting “Believing,” a new project for The Times. This project is personal to me. I was raised a devout Mormon in Arkansas. I’ve left the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I understand how wrestling with belief can define a life. I hoped to capture what that journey looked like for others, too — both inside and outside of religion. I interviewed hundreds of people, visited dozens of houses of worship and asked Times readers for their stories. More than 4,000 responded.

In my reporting, I found that there are many reasons for this shift in American life. Researchers say the pandemic and the country’s limited social safety nets have inclined people to stick with (or even turn to) religion for support. But there is another reason, too: [Many Americans are dissatisfied with the alternatives to religion](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/style/religion-america.html). They feel an existential malaise, and they’re looking for help. People want stronger communities, more meaningful rituals and spaces to express their spirituality. They’re also longing to have richer, more nuanced conversations about belief.

## Unsatisfying alternatives

Over the past few decades, around 40 million Americans left churches, and the number of people who say they have no religion grew to about 30 percent of the country.

Many people turned to their jobs, gym classes (yoga, CrossFit, SoulCycle) and mysticism (astrology apps and meditation) for answers on how to live well. Some stopped speaking about their past faith — it was unfashionable, in big cities and on college campuses, to do so.

Studies provide a sense of how that’s going: “There is overwhelming empirical support for the value of being at a house of worship on a regular basis on all kinds of metrics — mental health, physical health, having more friends, being less lonely,” said Ryan Burge, a former pastor and a leading researcher on religious trends.

People who practice a religion tend to be happier than those who don’t, a study by the Pew Research Center found. They are also healthier: They are significantly less likely to be depressed or to die prematurely from suicide, alcoholism, cancer, cardiovascular illness or other causes, multiple studies from Harvard found.

This isn’t true for everyone, of course. Many people have built happy, healthy lives outside of faith, and about a third of Americans who have left religion appear to be doing just fine, according to a new study from Burge.

But in aggregate, religion seems to help people by giving them what sociologists call the “three B’s” — **belief** in something, **belonging** in a community and **behaviors** to guide their lives.

Religion fills a psychological need, Michele Margolis, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. “We want to feel connection,” she said. “We want to feel like life makes sense.” Finding these things alone or creating them from scratch is “really hard,” she added.

## A new conversation

Now, something is shifting.

Most Americans identify as religious (around 70 percent of adults), and many are very committed to their faith (44 percent of Americans say they pray at least once a day). For the first time in decades, America’s religiosity is remaining stable. This may change, of course, in the coming years, especially as young people age.

But for now, many “nones” — people who have no religious affiliation — that I spoke to seem to have a dawning recognition that, in leaving faith, they threw “the baby out with the baptismal water,” as my Opinion colleague Michelle Cottle said.

Some are even converting to a religion. Depressed and doomscrolling during the pandemic, Matt McDonough, a 39-year-old in Minnesota, said he found a “profound” community in a men’s Bible study. “I got baptized as an adult. My mental and physical health improved dramatically.”

Most say they aren’t going back to religion. But many people told me they want new spaces to discuss and explore their spirituality. “My inner life is rich with spiritual reflection, and I sometimes yearn for a more open dialogue about it,” said Doris Andújar, 42, from Ponce, P.R.

## Looking for belief

Conservatives seem to be better at naming this longing. They speak to “civilizational” renewal and a restoration of moral values. They promise deliverance through politics. They use the infrastructure of evangelical Christianity to communicate their vision. It’s working for them.

But is this the only way? Successful alternatives haven’t emerged at scale, and many liberals have ignored American spirituality — this longing — at their party’s peril.

This data reveals that finding a way forward may require acknowledging that Americans want to wrestle with hard questions about how to live. They’re looking to heady concepts — confession, atonement, forgiveness and sacrifice — for answers.

In short, they’re looking to believe in something.

### **THE SUNDAY DEBATE**

**Was the backlash against the all-women Blue Origin flight fair?**

**Yes.** The event, framed as female empowerment, felt tone deaf as rich celebrities celebrated themselves in a climate where women’s rights are attacked. “White billionaire men using women to showcase their technological prowess … is completely cringe,” [HuffPost’s Kimberley Richards writes.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/blue-origin-backlash-feminism_l_68001a2ee4b0485a7732bcd7?d_id=8968066)

**No.** The public is jealous of these women’s success and ignores the representation the flight offers to a younger generation. “The women are part of a generation that are breaking the norm, that are changing the traditional pathway to space,” [argues Vanessa O’Brien for Britain’s Times Radio.](https://www.tiktok.com/@listentotimesradio/video/7493463970523729174)

### **FROM OPINION**

The egg industry gasses or grinds up newborn male chicks, but [technology could end the gruesome practice](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/opinion/eggs-chicken-in-ovo-sexing.html), **Sy Montgomery** writes.

**Most clicked yesterday:** A brother and sister sought a homestead that could house three generations. See [which home they chose](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/17/realestate/hudson-valley-kingston-saugerties-homes.html).

**Vows:** He saw her on a billboard. [Then fate brought them together](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/style/kellie-brown-chike-ozah-wedding.html).

**Lives Lived:** Mike Wood, prompted by his son’s struggles with reading, founded LeapFrog Enterprises, which in 1999 introduced the LeapPad, a child’s computer tablet that was a kind of talking book. Wood’s toys taught a generation. He [died at 72](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/business/michael-c-wood-dead.html).

_This week’s Interview subject is Nate Bargatze, whose low-key, G-rated stand-up has made him a mainstream star while still earning the respect of comedy snobs. Self-deprecation is one of his trademarks — his new book is titled “Big Dumb Eyes: Stories from a Simpler Mind” — but he also harbors some huge ambitions, on the business level and the spiritual one._

**You joke in your book about not being much of a reader, and to help** **_your_** **readers, you threw in some blank pages.**

For people to keep their head above water.

**Now that you’ve written one, are you feeling any differently about books?**

I did think last night, as I was watching TV, “This is when you should be _reading_.” I was thinking about trying to get into a fun book. Start with something superfun and get into a habit.

**What would that book be?**

I looked up the most popular books. It was Christina Agathie? Is that her name?

**Agatha Christie?**

I was backward. I think I’m dyslexic so that should count as I said it correctly in my head.

**That wasn’t a bit? Christina Agathie?**

No, I thought that’s what it was.

**I’m sorry.**

I ride the line: You don’t know what’s a bit, what’s not a bit. No one can really tell what’s going on, and then, depending on who I’m talking to, I can decide if it was dumb or not.
