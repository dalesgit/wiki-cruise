# Your Monthly Ritual: The Power of Hope - dhath12@gmail.com - Gmail

Hi there, 

​

I’d like to take a brief moment to reintroduce myself. I’m Matt Bloom, co-founder of Ritual. In this new monthly newsletter, I look forward to sharing reflections and insights on wellbeing with you.

​

Over the past year, I’ve been thinking a lot about hope and specifically playwright and political dissident Václav Havel’s description of hope in _Disturbing the Peace_: 

​

>“Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going well, or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously headed for early success, but, rather, an ability to work for something because it is good, not just because it stands a chance to succeed…It is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out.” 

​

I know many of us feel overwhelmed by the state of the world, especially when it seems like there’s nothing we can do about it. New psychological conditions like climate anxiety and political trauma are becoming more common. We want to make a difference, but what can we actually do?

​

Research shows that being hopeful, working for good, is crucial for surviving life’s ups and downs, especially when things seem, well, hopeless. I keep running into other wise voices—spiritual leaders, activists, Nobel peace laureates—who all agree that hope is the only way forward when life gets tough.

​

So, I remind myself every day to have hope, as Havel described—to keep working in whatever way I can to be a force for good: spreading compassion, serving others, showing kindness, and working for justice. At Ritual, we call that 'stepping together'—doing what we can to care for ourselves and the world around us. When things feel really desperate, I hope we can all remember that practicing hope, just as Havel did, is always possible.

​

Until next time,

​
