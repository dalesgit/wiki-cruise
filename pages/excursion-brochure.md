Reasons for limiting capacity may include the number of transportation seats available, or the need to maintain a safe ratio of guides for hikes, fishing and water activities.

Frequently Asked Questions
What should I wear?
Comfortable walking shoes are recommended for all shore excursions. When you visit places of worship, we recommend dressing conservatively (no shorts or sleeveless tops), but casual clothing is perfectly acceptable. Dress in layers and have a jacket along.  Bring an umbrella or raincoat, a hat and sunscreen.
What about meals?  Most tour departures complement the ship’s meal service hours. In-room dining is available on board.  How will I know what time each tour departs?
The on-board Shore Excurions Order Form in your stateroom will show departure times. This information will also be printed on your shore excursions tickets, which you will receive on board. Approximate tour departure times are posted on our website at hollandamerica.com.
I am traveling with friends. Can we be accommodated on the same motorcoach?
The departure location for each tour is printed on your shore excursions tickets. If you wish to travel with friends, please arrive at the designated meeting place together. This will enable the staff to allocate space for you on the same vehicle.
Tour durations
The individual tour descriptions include approximate durations. To allow our Shore Excursions Managers flexibility to coordinate your time in port with meals and activities on the ship, exact departure times are published in the Shore Excursions Order Form on board. For more information, please attend the Shore Excursions Presentation or visit the Shore Excursions Desk.
Tour descriptions
Tour descriptions may change after printing.  Information that becomes available after this brochure is published will be posted in the Shore Excursions section of our website, which can be found online at hollandamerica.com. Significant changes will be noted on the Shore Excursions Order Form on board. Tour schedules are subject to change.

The tours are graded according to the relative level of activity they entail. The activity icons that appear at the beginning of each tour description provide a general idea of the level of activity to expect. Please see page 1 for specific information or speak to a Shore Excursions specialist (1.888.425.9376). It is important to keep in mind that tour operators are subject to the laws of their own country with respect to accommodating the needs of guests with disabilities. In most foreign countries, the laws are not as stringent as those in the United States.

Will I encounter difficulties (dis)embarking the ship when it’s in port?

Please see the on-board Shore Excursions staff to help determine whether you can expect to encounter difficulties (dis)embarking the ship in a particular port of call. The decision whether or not to carry or provide other mobility assistance to a guest and their device (wheelchair, walker, etc.) up or down a ship’s gangway, or on or off a tender boat, is at the sole discretion of the Captain, made based on his evaluation of guest and crew safety.  We encourage you to bring a collapsible wheelchair as space limitations may restrict the ability of some tour operators to accommodate motorized mobility aid devices.

of transportation are available in all locations.

Online Reservations

The fastest and easiest way for you to reserve
and pay for your Signature Collection experience

cost will be per mode of transportation (not per
person), so only one person in the party needs
to make the reservation. The price shown on the
website is the total cost for the transportation,
driver and guide (not a per-person price). In many
ports, availability is extremely limited. We encourage

Not Included (Unless Otherwise Noted)

Guests’ entrance fees for attractions are not included
in the price due to the wide range of attraction
possibilities, uncertain number of attractions to be visited,
and varying number of guests participating. We strongly
recommend that you bring some local currency to cover
such costs as credit cards are not readily accepted in
some ports. Lunch will not be included on any tour
as many guests prefer to select their own dining
venue.
