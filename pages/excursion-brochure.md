Comfortable walking shoes are recommended for all shore excursions. When you visit places of worship, we recommend dressing conservatively (no shorts or sleeveless tops), but casual clothing is perfectly acceptable. Dress in layers and have a jacket along.  Bring an umbrella or raincoat, a hat and sunscreen.
What about meals?  Most tour departures complement the ship’s meal service hours. In-room dining is available on board.  How will I know what time each tour departs?
The on-board Shore Excurions Order Form in your stateroom will show departure times. This information will also be printed on your shore excursions tickets, which you will receive on board. Approximate tour departure times are posted on our website at hollandamerica.com.
I am traveling with friends. Can we be accommodated on the same motorcoach?
The departure location for each tour is printed on your shore excursions tickets. If you wish to travel with friends, please arrive at the designated meeting place together. This will enable the staff to allocate space for you on the same vehicle.
Tour durations
The individual tour descriptions include approximate durations. To allow our Shore Excursions Managers flexibility to coordinate your time in port with meals and activities on the ship, exact departure times are published in the Shore Excursions Order Form on board. For more information, please attend the Shore Excursions Presentation or visit the Shore Excursions Desk.
Tour descriptions
Tour descriptions may change after printing.  Information that becomes available after this brochure is published will be posted in the Shore Excursions section of our website, which can be found online at hollandamerica.com.

It is important to keep in mind that tour operators are subject to the laws of their own country with respect to accommodating the needs of guests with disabilities. In most foreign countries, the laws are not as stringent as those in the United States.

Will I encounter difficulties (dis)embarking the ship when it’s in port?

Please see the on-board Shore Excursions staff to help determine whether you can expect to encounter difficulties (dis)embarking the ship in a particular port of call. The decision whether or not to carry or provide other mobility assistance to a guest and their device (wheelchair, walker, etc.) up or down a ship’s gangway, or on or off a tender boat, is at the sole discretion of the Captain, made based on his evaluation of guest and crew safety.  We encourage you to bring a collapsible wheelchair as space limitations may restrict the ability of some tour operators to accommodate motorized mobility aid devices.

Sydney, Australia - Sunday, March 30, 2025: First came the Aborigines, 50,000 years ago; then 759 British
convicts, followed by a wave of military settlers known as the “Rum Corps.” The result: Sydney’s bold, egalitarian charm. History, opera,
opals and koalas are all here.
Discover the Blue Mountains
Departs: 8:00 AM
Approximately 8½ Hours
Adult $279.95; Child $249.95

Travel west of Sydney by motorcoach towards
the Blue Mountains. Despite its name, this
UNESCO World Heritage site isn't
mountainous at all. In fact, it's an area of
scenic, rugged, low-elevation tablelands
covering more than 2.5 million acres. Some
wonderful cultural and landscape surprises
await you.
Visit Featherdale Wildlife Park for an
introduction to the amazing (and very
bizarre) spectrum of Australian wildlife. Just a
few feet away from you -- and in some cases
roaming quite freely within the park -- are
wallabies, kangaroos, koalas, reptiles,
Tasmanian devils, wombats and many
Australian species of bird. Photo
opportunities abound, and you can pay extra
to have your photo taken with a fuzzy koala
who enjoys cuddles as much as you do.
At the Blue Mountains, you'll realize that the
attraction here is not what rises above but,
rather, what lies beneath. A stop at the Echo
Point viewpoint shows what the "mountains"
are all about -- they are canyons deeply
incised through the tablelands, with some
intriguing landforms carved by wind and
water. You will have a very impressive view of
the Three Sisters -- eroded columns whose
existence has given rise to a wealth of

Aboriginal lore. Take in panoramic views of
the Jamieson Valley, Mount Solitary and the
Ruined Castle as well.
At Scenic World, take a ride on the Scenic
Cableway -- Australia's steepest aerial cable
car. Crossing 886 feet above the Jamison
Valley; enjoy the views of ancient ravines and
dazzling waterfalls.
A two-course traditional lunch is served at
the Mountain Heritage Hotel. Boasting
unrivalled views over the Blue Mountains,
this quaint property lends an old-world,
English-style ambience to your day.

Travel into the lush Nu'uanu Valley through a
tropical rain forest en route to the worldfamous Pali Lookout. The Nu'uanu Pali was
the site of the Battle of Nu'uanu -- one of the
most critical battles in Hawaiian history,
when King Kamehameha I conquered the
island of Oahu, bringing it under his rule.
After driving through a spectacular tree
tunnel, you'll arrive at Hawaii's sacred Royal
Mausoleum -- the final resting place of six of
the kingdom's last eight ruling monarchs.

long clothing suitable for use as a cover-up.
Bring a hat and sunglasses; wear

Royal history would not be complete without
understanding the role Christian missionaries
played in shaping the islands. At the
Hawaiian Mission Houses Historic Site &
Archives (HMH), you will visit three restored
houses, two of which are the oldest houses in
Hawaii. Here, you'll learn about the research

archives, which provide a unique glimpse into
19th-century Hawaii, both on site and online.
HMH was designated a National Historic
Landmark in 1965.
Next, walk to the Kawaiahao Church and the
statue of legendary King Kamehameha. A
self-guided tour inside a true Hawaiian
treasure -- Iolani Palace -- follows. This is the
only royal palace in the United States and was
the official residence of the Hawaiian
Kingdom's last two monarchs -- King
Kalakaua, who built the palace in 1882, and
his sister and successor, Queen Lili'uokalani.

landmark. This extinct volcano was named by
sailors in the 1800s who, from a distance,
mistook the glitter of calcite crystals in the
lava rock for diamonds.
From there, drive through the residential area
of Kahala and out to Hanauma Bay, a curved
bay formed when the side of a crater collapsed
thousands of years ago. Keep an eye out for
humpback whales that frequent the waters
along this coastline.
You'll also travel past Halona Point -- a
famous blowhole where a geyser of seawater
erupts from a submerged lava tube. From
there, the ride takes you around Makapu'u
Point, rising 647 feet above the ocean and the
site of a prominent lighthouse. Pause to visit a
gift shop with restrooms and time to enjoy a
tasty, cool island treat.
From the higher elevation of the Ko'olau
Mountains and the Pali Lookout, take in

side. It was here, in 1795, that King
Kamehameha I forced hundreds of his
opponents to jump to their deaths from the
cliffs.
Sit back and contemplate the beauty of Oahu
on the scenic and relaxing ride back to the
ship.

Oahu's Scenic Shores
Departs: 8:00 AM
Approximately 4 Hours
Adult $129.95; Child $109.95

Enjoy this scenic, narrated drive along the
south and east shores of the Island of Oahu.
Start with a journey past world-famous
Diamond Head, Hawaii's most recognized
landmark. This extinct volcano was named by
sailors in the 1800s who, from a distance,
mistook the glitter of calcite crystals in the
lava rock for diamonds.

From there, drive through the residential area
of Kahala and out to Hanauma Bay, a curved
bay formed when the side of a crater collapsed
thousands of years ago. Keep an eye out for
humpback whales that frequent the waters
along this coastline.
You'll also travel past Halona Point -- a
famous blowhole where a geyser of seawater
erupts from a submerged lava tube. From
there, the ride takes you around Makapu'u
Point, rising 647 feet above the ocean and the
site of a prominent lighthouse. Pause to visit a
gift shop with restrooms and time to enjoy a
tasty, cool island treat.
From the higher elevation of the Ko'olau
Mountains and the Pali Lookout, take in
sweeping views of the island's lush windward
side. It was here, in 1795, that King
Kamehameha I forced hundreds of his
opponents to jump to their deaths from the
cliffs.
Sit back and contemplate the beauty of Oahu
on the scenic and relaxing ride back to the
ship.
Notes:
Tour requires about 300 yards of walking.

interpretive wayside exhibits. These thoughtprovoking displays invite visitors to imagine

Harbor as it was in 1941 over the bustling
port as it appears today, these exhibits bridge

row" at Ford Island. The 887 foot long
"Mighty Mo" battleship is a living museum
that offers guests a glimpse into the past and
the experience of being aboard a ship that is
alive with history as well as modern
technology. You will be educated and
entertained with exhibits, memorabilia, and
activities that give you a sense of what life at
sea was like aboard the world's last and most
celebrated battleship. Discover the thrilling
details of the kamikaze attack on the USS
Missouri; stand in the shadows of the 16-inch
guns that pummeled Inchon, Korea; see
where 28 Tomahawk missiles were launched
during the Gulf War and stand on the

MacArthur stood when Japanese officials
signed and presented him with the "Articles
of Surrender" that ended World War II. Upon

find answers to frequently asked questions and read
general information. Remember, online and phone shore
excursion reservations are processed prior to any requests
made on board the ship and receive priority handling. At

the time of making your reservations online, we will advise
you whether or not your reservations are confirmed or
whether you have been waitlisted. Your credit card will be
charged immediately for all confirmed reservations. Should
space become available for a waitlisted tours request, we
will e-mail or otherwise contact you at that time and either
immediately charge your credit card if you have already
given us your credit card information or ask you to provide
us with that information for immediate charge processing.
Reservations for shore excursions are subject to cancellation
by us at any time prior to the credit card charge being
accepted by your bank. If you or Holland America cancel
a tour (except Overland Adventures and Overnights) more
than 3 days prior to cruise departure, we will issue a credit
on the credit card that you used to pay for the reservation.
For any cancellation within 3 days of departure, a credit
will not be given on your credit card. Instead, we will apply
an ONBOARD CREDIT ONLY policy under which the

to the shipboard account of the person who was to take
the tour. If the credit is not fully utilized during the cruise,
the balance will be paid to that guest by the ship’s Purser.

physician, Health Department and/or travel medicine clinic
to discuss immunization requirements for all countries on

your itinerary. You can also check the Centers for Disease

idea to bring along a record of your immunizations, as
requirements for immunizations may change. It is the
guests’ responsibility to remain apprised of changes in
immunization policies, so that they have all the required
inoculations and immunizations at the time of departure.
Safety

We take steps to identify and contract with reputable
tour operators. Tour operators must comply with local
government requirements and carry liability insurance
in amounts consistent with local standards to address
personal injury and property damage.

Each guest is responsible for obtaining all visas needed
to join the cruise. Unless otherwise noted, it is the guest’s

changes. Passports, visas (other than as specified above),
