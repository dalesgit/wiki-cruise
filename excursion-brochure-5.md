Re-live history with a visit to Pearl Harbor
and the USS Missouri.
Pearl Harbor: Self-guided tour
There are two Exhibit Galleries: "Road to
War" and "Attack". Immerse yourself in the
history as you explore these two galleries.
These two galleries vividly depict the events
leading up to the attack on Oahu and its
aftermath. Discover personal memorabilia,
dramatic photographs, and authentic battle
artifacts. Kiosks allow you to hear firsthand
accounts from those who witnessed this
pivotal moment. You may also visit the Pearl
Harbor Memorial Theater located across
from the exhibit galleries. Here, you can
watch a 23-minute film about the December
7, 1941, attack. Showings begin every 15 and
45 minutes past the hour. You can also view
the Interpretive Wayside Exhibits.
Throughout the facility, you’ll find
interpretive wayside exhibits. These thoughtprovoking displays invite visitors to imagine
the experience of that tragic day. By
superimposing descriptive images of Pearl
Harbor as it was in 1941 over the bustling
port as it appears today, these exhibits bridge
the past and the present.
USS Missouri:
To visit the USS Missouri, you’ll need to take
the Pearl Harbor shuttle to Ford Island.

Shuttles depart the Pearl Harbor visitors
center regularly. Please look for the signs
indicating the shuttle pick-up area. The USS
Missouri is berthed on the former "battleship
row" at Ford Island. The 887 foot long
"Mighty Mo" battleship is a living museum
that offers guests a glimpse into the past and
the experience of being aboard a ship that is
alive with history as well as modern
technology. You will be educated and
entertained with exhibits, memorabilia, and
activities that give you a sense of what life at
sea was like aboard the world's last and most
celebrated battleship. Discover the thrilling
details of the kamikaze attack on the USS
Missouri; stand in the shadows of the 16-inch
guns that pummeled Inchon, Korea; see
where 28 Tomahawk missiles were launched
during the Gulf War and stand on the
"Signature Deck" where General Douglas
MacArthur stood when Japanese officials
signed and presented him with the "Articles
of Surrender" that ended World War II. Upon
arrival at the USS Missouri, you can join one
of the guided tours or you may navigate the
ship on your own. When the tour is
complete, take the shuttle back to the Pearl
Harbor visitors center to join up with your
fellow cruise ship passengers.
After your self-guided visit of Pearl Harbor is
complete, you’ll proceed on a tour of
metropolitan Honolulu. Highlights include
Iolani Palace, The sole royal palace on
American soil, rich in Hawaiian history.

mistook the glitter of calcite crystals in the
lava rock for diamonds.

From there, drive through the residential area
of Kahala and out to Hanauma Bay, a curved
bay formed when the side of a crater collapsed
thousands of years ago. Keep an eye out for
humpback whales that frequent the waters
along this coastline.
You'll also travel past Halona Point -- a
famous blowhole where a geyser of seawater
erupts from a submerged lava tube. From
there, the ride takes you around Makapu'u
Point, rising 647 feet above the ocean and the
site of a prominent lighthouse. Pause to visit a
gift shop with restrooms and time to enjoy a
tasty, cool island treat.
From the higher elevation of the Ko'olau
Mountains and the Pali Lookout, take in
sweeping views of the island's lush windward
side. It was here, in 1795, that King
Kamehameha I forced hundreds of his
opponents to jump to their deaths from the
cliffs.
Sit back and contemplate the beauty of Oahu
on the scenic and relaxing ride back to the
ship.
Notes:
Tour requires about 300 yards of walking.
Terrain includes uneven surfaces. Wear
sturdy non-skid walking shoes. Other than
the two stops near Diamond Head Crater and
at Pali Lookout, this tour consists mainly of

Adult $155.95; Child $129.95

Re-live history with a visit to Pearl Harbor
and the USS Missouri.
Pearl Harbor: Self-guided tour
There are two Exhibit Galleries: "Road to
War" and "Attack". Immerse yourself in the
history as you explore these two galleries.
These two galleries vividly depict the events
leading up to the attack on Oahu and its
aftermath. Discover personal memorabilia,
dramatic photographs, and authentic battle
artifacts. Kiosks allow you to hear firsthand
accounts from those who witnessed this
pivotal moment. You may also visit the Pearl
Harbor Memorial Theater located across
from the exhibit galleries. Here, you can
watch a 23-minute film about the December
7, 1941, attack. Showings begin every 15 and
45 minutes past the hour. You can also view
the Interpretive Wayside Exhibits.
Throughout the facility, you’ll find
interpretive wayside exhibits. These thoughtprovoking displays invite visitors to imagine
the experience of that tragic day. By
superimposing descriptive images of Pearl
Harbor as it was in 1941 over the bustling
port as it appears today, these exhibits bridge
the past and the present.
USS Missouri:
To visit the USS Missouri, you’ll need to take
the Pearl Harbor shuttle to Ford Island.

Shuttles depart the Pearl Harbor visitors
center regularly. Please look for the signs
indicating the shuttle pick-up area. The USS
Missouri is berthed on the former "battleship
row" at Ford Island. The 887 foot long
"Mighty Mo" battleship is a living museum
that offers guests a glimpse into the past and
the experience of being aboard a ship that is
alive with history as well as modern
technology. You will be educated and
entertained with exhibits, memorabilia, and
activities that give you a sense of what life at
sea was like aboard the world's last and most
celebrated battleship. Discover the thrilling
details of the kamikaze attack on the USS
Missouri; stand in the shadows of the 16-inch
guns that pummeled Inchon, Korea; see
where 28 Tomahawk missiles were launched
during the Gulf War and stand on the
"Signature Deck" where General Douglas
MacArthur stood when Japanese officials
signed and presented him with the "Articles
of Surrender" that ended World War II. Upon
arrival at the USS Missouri, you can join one
of the guided tours or you may navigate the
ship on your own. When the tour is

Harbor visitors center to join up with your
fellow cruise ship passengers.

this charming Provincial Capital.

## Victoria Culinary Walk
Departs:
Approximately 2½ Hours
Price $139.95

Perched on the southern tip of Vancouver
Island, Victoria is the capital of British
Columbia and an idyllic setting for a
gastronomic walking adventure. Join an
expert guide for a 2.5-hour food and history
tour and an exclusive glimpse into its
delicious culinary treasures.
After a short shuttle ride into the heart of
downtown, take a seat inside the Art Decostyle Steamship Terminal Building. Indulge in
local seafood chowder or a farm-to-table
salad paired with either a local beer, wine, or
non-alcoholic option. With a view out to the
Inner Harbour, this may be the perfect way to
enjoy the bounty of Vancouver Island.

You can't leave town before you've sampled a
Victoria Cream at Rogers' Chocolates. This is
Canada's oldest chocolate shop, dates back to
1885, and occupies prime real estate on
vibrant Government Street.
Take the shuttle back to the ship, proudly
sporting a goodie bag that includes some fun
local gems.

Hotel, the Royal British Columbia Museum,
and the lighter side of life with street
performers and food vendors galore.
Continue to Craigdarroch Castle -- the only
remaining vestige of the grand estate
belonging to industrialist Robert Dunsmuir.
Most of this four-story masterpiece has been
fully restored to its original condition after
having been used as both a hospital and a
college in the 1900s. Explore Craigdarroch on
a self-guided tour, and pianists are welcome
to play the castle's piano. Don't miss the castle
gift shop.
Back on the motorcoach, head into the

upscale residential neighborhoods. Perfectly
manicured lawns and abundant flowers
explain Victoria's nickname, "City of
Gardens," and beautiful coastal and mountain
views capture the essence of Western Canada.

Notes:
Tour requires a 100-yard incline walk from
the coach to the castle. The castle is not

and no elevator. Terrain includes even and

Self-Guided Touring

Guests who do not join these prearranged shore
excursions must rely on whatever transportation is
available in each port. If you choose to devise your own
excursion, we suggest that you remind the driver or tour
escort of the ship’s sailing time. Of course, the ship’s
facilities are fully available to guests while in port.
Reservations & Online Reservations

Now you can easily choose your tour times, book
your tours and receive confirmation of your shore
exucursions reservations 24 hours a day. Visit us online
at hollandamerica.com or phone us at 1-888-425-9376.
Book online now, up until 3 days before sailing. Make
your payment online via our secure website, and receive
confirmation as well as your tour departure times. You
can also download the shore excursions, view tour prices,
find answers to frequently asked questions and read
general information. Remember, online and phone shore
excursion reservations are processed prior to any requests
made on board the ship and receive priority handling. At

the time of making your reservations online, we will advise
you whether or not your reservations are confirmed or
whether you have been waitlisted. Your credit card will be
charged immediately for all confirmed reservations. Should
space become available for a waitlisted tours request, we
will e-mail or otherwise contact you at that time and either
immediately charge your credit card if you have already
given us your credit card information or ask you to provide
us with that information for immediate charge processing.
Reservations for shore excursions are subject to cancellation
by us at any time prior to the credit card charge being
accepted by your bank. If you or Holland America cancel
a tour (except Overland Adventures and Overnights) more
than 3 days prior to cruise departure, we will issue a credit
on the credit card that you used to pay for the reservation.
For any cancellation within 3 days of departure, a credit
will not be given on your credit card. Instead, we will apply
an ONBOARD CREDIT ONLY policy under which the
refund (less any cancellation fee) will show up as a credit
to the shipboard account of the person who was to take
the tour. If the credit is not fully utilized during the cruise,
the balance will be paid to that guest by the ship’s Purser.
Once on board, if you cancel your tour reservation after the
booking deadline stated in the Shore Excursion Planning
Form on board, a 100% cancellation fee will apply since
transportation and services will have already been arranged.
If space on the tour you have ordered is not available
you will be contacted to see if you are interested
in another tour selection. You may receive
confirmation of your tours via e-mail. Vouchers
for each confirmed tour will be delivered to your
stateroom after embarkation.
Immunizations

Immunizations may be required for some of the ports of
call included in your voyage. Please contact your local
physician, Health Department and/or travel medicine clinic
to discuss immunization requirements for all countries on

your itinerary. You can also check the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention’s website at cdc.gov. Click on
Travelers’ Health and then Vaccinations. It is also a good
idea to bring along a record of your immunizations, as
requirements for immunizations may change. It is the
guests’ responsibility to remain apprised of changes in
immunization policies, so that they have all the required
inoculations and immunizations at the time of departure.
Safety

We take steps to identify and contract with reputable
tour operators. Tour operators must comply with local
government requirements and carry liability insurance
in amounts consistent with local standards to address
personal injury and property damage.
Visa Requirements

Each guest is responsible for obtaining all visas needed
to join the cruise. Unless otherwise noted, it is the guest’s
sole responsibility to obtain any necessary visas to
participate in any Overland Adventures and Overnights.
Guests must keep themselves apprised of policy
changes. Passports, visas (other than as specified above),
tourist cards, and vaccinations, if required, are the sole
responsibility of the guest. Remember, guests must have a
passport that is valid for at least six months beyond the
completion of their trip.
