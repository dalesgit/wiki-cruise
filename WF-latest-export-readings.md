### [‘A case study in groupthink’: were liberals wrong about the pandemic? | US politics | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/05/covid-policies-lockdown-masks-liberals-book?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other)
  -  ‘A case study in groupthink’: were liberals wrong about the pandemic? | US politics | The Guardian
  - Were conservatives right to question [Covid](https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak) lockdowns? Were the liberals who defended them less grounded in science than they believed? And did liberal dismissiveness of the other side come at a cost that Americans will continue to pay for many years?
  - A new book by two political scientists argues yes to all three questions, making the case that the aggressive policies that the US and other countries adopted to fight Covid – including school shutdowns, business closures, mask mandates and social distancing – were in some cases misguided and in many cases deserved more rigorous public debate.
  - In their peer-reviewed [book](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691267135/in-covids-wake?srsltid=AfmBOoopaXYBoFaN7vkJJJs4dhGEE5V5A72kVtB6tc922n18MduioePN), In Covid’s Wake: How Our Politics Failed Us, Stephen Macedo and Frances Lee argue that public health authorities, the mainstream media, and progressive elites often pushed pandemic measures without weighing their costs and benefits, and ostracized people who expressed good-faith disagreement.

  - “Policy learning seemed to be short-circuited during the pandemic,” Lee said. “It became so moralized, like: ‘We’re not interested in looking at how other people are \[responding to the pandemic\], because only bad people would do it a different way from the way we’re doing’.”
  - She and Macedo spoke to the Guardian by video call. The [Princeton University](https://www.theguardian.com/education/princeton-university) professors both consider themselves left-leaning, and the book grew out of research Macedo was doing on the ways progressive discourse gets handicapped by a refusal to engage with conservative or outside arguments. “Covid is an amazing case study in groupthink and the effects of partisan bias,” he said.
  - Many Covid stances presented as public health consensus were not as grounded in empirical evidence as many Americans may have believed, Macedo and Lee argue. At times, scientific and health authorities acted less like neutral experts and [more like](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/opinion/covid-pandemic-lab-leak.html) self-interested actors, engaging in PR efforts to downplay uncertainty, missteps or conflicts of interest.
  - It’s a controversial argument. Covid-19 killed more than a million Americans, [according](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_deaths-total) to US government estimates. The early days of the pandemic left hospitals overwhelmed, morgues overflowing, and scientists scrambling to understand the new disease and how to contain it.
  - Still, Macedo and Lee say, it is unclear why shutdowns and closures went on so long, particularly in [Democratic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats) states. The book argues that in the US the pandemic became more politically polarized over time, after, initially, “only modest policy differences between [Republican](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans)\- and Democratic-leaning states”.
  - After April 2020, however, red and blue America diverged. [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) contributed to that polarization by [downplaying](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/21/837348551/timeline-what-trump-has-said-and-done-about-the-coronavirus) the severity of the virus. Significant policy differences also emerged. Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, moved to re-open physical schools quickly, which progressives characterized as irresponsible.
  - Yet in the end there was “no meaningful difference” in Covid mortality rates between Democratic and Republican states in the pre-vaccine period, according to CDC data cited in the book, despite Republican states’ more lenient policies. Macedo and Lee also favorably compare Sweden, which controversially avoided mass lockdowns but [ultimately](https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/34/4/737/7675929) had a lower mortality rate than many other European countries.
  - The shutdowns had foreseeable and quantifiable costs, they say, many of which we are still paying. [Learning loss](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/briefing/covid-learning-losses.html) and [school absenteeism](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/parents-are-not-fully-aware-of-or-concerned-about-their-childrens-school-attendance/) soared. Inflation went through the roof thanks in part to lockdown spending and stimulus payments. Small businesses defaulted; other medical treatments like cancer screenings and [mental health care](https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-covid-19-pandemic-triggers-25-increase-in-prevalence-of-anxiety-and-depression-worldwide) suffered; and rates of loneliness and [crime](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/upshot/murder-decline-pandemic-cities.html) increased. The economic strain on poor and minority Americans was particularly severe.
  - Covid policies escalated into culture wars, amplifying tensions around other social issues. Teachers’ unions, which are often bastions of Democratic support, painted school re-openings as “rooted in sexism, racism, and misogyny” and “a recipe for … structural racism”, the book notes, despite the fact that minority and poor students were most [disadvantaged](https://jsri.msu.edu/publications/nexo/vol-xxiv/no-2-spring-2021/racial-ethnic-differences-in-education-disruptions-during-the-covid-19-pandemic) by remote learning.
  - These measures also had a literal price. “In inflation-adjusted terms,” Macedo and Lee write, “the United States spent more on pandemic aid in 2020 than it spent on the 2009 stimulus package and the New Deal combined” – or about what the US spent on war production in 1943.

  - Yet of the $5tn that the [US Congress](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress) authorized in 2020 and 2021 for Covid expenditure, only about 10% went to direct medical expenses such as hospitals or vaccine distribution, according to the book; most of the spending was on economic relief to people and businesses affected by shutdowns. Ten per cent of that relief was [stolen](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/2023/the-great-grift/) by fraud, according to the AP.
  - The pandemic was an emergency with no modern precedent, of course, and hindsight is easy. But In Covid’s Wake tries to take into account what information was known at the time – including earlier pandemic preparedness studies. Reports by [Johns Hopkins](https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/sites/default/files/2023-02/190918-gmpbreport-respiratorypathogen.pdf) (2019), the [World Health Organization](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf?sequence=1) (2019), [the state of Illinois](https://dph.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/idph/files/publications/illinois-pandemic-flu-plan-050316.pdf) (2014) and the [British government](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7c4767e5274a2041cf2ee3/dh_131040.pdf) (2011) had all expressed ambivalence or caution about the kind of quarantine measures that were soon taken.
  - “We take a look at the state of the evidence as it was in early 2020,” Lee said. “It was clear at the time that the evidence was quite unsettled around all of this, and if policymakers had been more honest with the public about these uncertainties, I think they would have maintained public trust better.”
  - The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security hosted a wargaming exercise in October 2019, shortly before the pandemic began, to simulate a deadly [coronavirus](https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/tabletop-exercises/event-201-pandemic-tabletop-exercise#scenario) pandemic; the [findings](https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/sites/default/files/2022-12/200117-publicprivatepandemiccalltoaction.pdf) explicitly urged that “\[t\]ravel and trade … be maintained even in the face of a pandemic”. Similarly, a WHO paper in 2019 said that some measures – such as border closures and contact tracing – were “not recommended in any circumstances”.
  - “And yet we did all of that in short order,” Macedo said, “and without people referring back to these plans.”
  - He and Lee also believe there was a strong element of class bias, with a left-leaning “laptop class” that could easily work from home touting anti-Covid measures that were much easier for some Americans to adopt than others. Many relatively affluent Americans became even [wealthier](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/american-income-wealth-surged-pandemic-federal-reserve/) during the pandemic, in part due to rising housing values.
  - At the same time, the laptop class was only able to socially isolate at home in part because other people risked exposure to provide groceries. Stay-at-home measures were partly intended to protect “essential workers”, but policymakers living in crisis-stricken major metropolitan areas such as New York or Washington DC did not reckon with why social distancing and other measures might be less important in rural parts of the country where Covid rates were lower.
  - Lockdowns were intended to slow Covid’s spread, yet previous pandemic recommendations had suggested they only be used very early in an outbreak and even then do not buy much time, Macedo said.
  - ![two people stand next to each other smiling ](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42e93bcca1f4fec173e7e153e13f034d02aab919/0_1331_3024_2701/master/3024.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)
  - Stephen Macedo and Frances Lee. Photograph: Courtesy of Stephen Macedo
  - Policymakers and experts often embraced stringent measures for reasons that are more political than medical, Macedo and Lee argue; in a pandemic, authorities are keen to assure anxious publics that they are “in charge” and “doing something”.
  - In strange contrast, policymakers and journalists in the US and elsewhere seemed to take China as a model, the book argues, despite the fact that China is an authoritarian state and had concealed the scale of the outbreak during the crucial early days of the pandemic. Its regime had obvious incentives to mislead foreign observers, and used draconian quarantine measures such as physically welding people into their homes.
  - When the WHO organized a joint China field mission with the Chinese government, in February 2020, non-Chinese researchers found it difficult to converse with their Chinese counterparts away from government handlers. Yet the WHO’s [report](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/report-of-the-who-china-joint-mission-on-coronavirus-disease-2019-/(covid-19/)) was “effusive in its praise” of China’s approach, the book notes.
  - “My view is that there was just a great deal of wishful thinking on the part of technocrats of all kinds,” Lee said. “They wanted there to be an answer – that if we do X and Y, we can prevent this disaster. And so they’re kind of grasping at straws. The Chinese example gave them hope.” She noted that Covid policymakers might have been better served if there had been people [assigned](https://x.com/smarterparrot/status/1898883545109508236) to act as [devil’s advocates](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/18/covid-inquiry-hallett-prescribes-red-teams-as-antidote-to-flawed-thinking) in internal deliberations.
  - Lee and Macedo are not natural scientists or public health professionals, they emphasize, and their book is about failures in public deliberation over Covid-19, rather than a prescription for managing pandemics.
  - But they do wade into the debate about Covid-19’s origin, arguing that the “lab leak” hypothesis – that Covid-19 accidentally leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, rather than spontaneously leaping from animals to humans – was unfairly dismissed.
  - The Wuhan Institute studied coronaviruses similar to the one responsible for Covid-19, had a documented history of safety breaches, was located near the outbreak, and is known to have experimented on viruses using [controversial](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7128689/) [“gain-of-function”](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/coronavirus-lab-escape-theory.html) methods funded by the US, which involve mutating pathogens to see what they might look like in a more advanced or dangerous form.
  - Perhaps because Trump had fanned racial paranoia by calling Covid-19 the “[China virus](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates)” and [rightwing influencers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/america-far-right-coronavirus-outbreak-trump-alex-jones) were spreading the notion that it had been deliberately engineered and unleashed on the world by China, many scientists, public health experts and [journalists](https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-medias-lab-leak-fiasco?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=twitter) reacted by [framing](https://www.thewrap.com/new-york-times-covid-lab-leak-apoorva-mandavilli/) the idea of a lab leak – even an accidental one – as an offensive conspiracy theory. Dr Anthony Fauci and other top public health figures were evasive or in some cases dishonest about the possibility of a lab leak, Macedo and Lee say, as well as the fact that a US non-profit funded by the National Institutes of Health allegedly [funded](https://theintercept.com/2021/09/09/covid-origins-gain-of-function-research/) gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute.
  - Since then, though, the CIA and other US intelligence agencies have cautiously [endorsed](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/26/cia-now-backs-lab-leak-theory-to-explain-origins-of-covid-19) the lab leak theory, and the discourse around Covid has softened somewhat. The economist Emily Oster sparked immense backlash by [arguing](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/schools-arent-superspreaders/616669/) against school closures in 2020. Now publications such as New York Magazine and the New York Times have [acknowledged](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/03/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html) the plausibility of the lab leak hypothesis, for example, and there is growing consensus that school closures hurt many children.
  - The reception to In Covid’s Wake has been [more](https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-coronavirus-consensus-was-wrong) [positive](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/09/opinion/covid-five-year-anniversary-2020-mistakes/) than Macedo and Lee expected – perhaps a sign that some of their arguments have penetrated the mainstream, if not that we’ve gotten better as a society at talking about difficult things. “The reception of the book has been much less controversial \[and\] contentious than we expected,” Macedo said.
  - Yet the wounds fester and debates continue. Some [readers](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/podcasts/the-daily/were-the-covid-lockdowns-worth-it.html#commentsContainer) of the New York Times were furious when The Daily, the newspaper’s flagship podcast, recently interviewed them, with subscribers arguing that the episode was not sufficiently critical of their stance. And some coverage of the book has [criticized](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/laptopclassbook/) it for underplaying the danger of the disease.
  - Macedo and Lee said that a few of their colleagues have expressed concern that their critique could fuel political attacks on science – a worry that crossed their minds too. “Our response is that the best way to refute criticisms that science and universities have been politicized is to be open to criticism and willing to engage in self-criticism,” Macedo said.
  - “We need to make sure these institutions are in the best possible working order to face the challenges ahead. And we think that’s by being honest, not by covering over mistakes or being unwilling to face up to hard questions.”

  - A completely new ecosystem has emerged on the Hawaiian island of O'ahu composed of a mishmash of species from elsewhere (Credit: Sean MacDonald)
  - **Ecosystems which have never been seen before are being accidentally created by humans. They offer a stark look into the nature of tomorrow.**
  - Venture deep into the forests on O'ahu, Hawaii's third largest island, and you'll find yourself threading through a dense understory of richly scented pepper, cinnamon and guava trees.
  - "It's beautiful," says Corey Tarwater, an ecologist at the University of Wyoming in the US who began researching O'ahu's ecosystems in 2014. Sounds like the "cheww-chewww" song of the pale green warbling white-eye and the chattering, almost electrical call of the red-billed leiothrix surround you. "There's really neat lizards around," adds Tarwater. "There's these highly structured forests with these amazing tropical plant species."
  - For hikers setting out on O'ahu's mountain trails, these are thrilling wildernesses within easy reach of Hawaii's capital, Honolulu, says Tarwater. Yet nothing is quite as it might seem, she adds. "You wouldn't know unless you study them, but if you walk around any forest around Honolulu, there's not going to be one single native plant species there."
  - If you removed all people from the planet, Hawaii would be on a different evolutionary ecological trajectory going forward – Jens-Christian Svenning
  - O'ahu's mountainous terrain – a filming location that has evoked heroic, untrammelled wildernesses in the Jurassic Park and King Kong films – is shaped "at every level" by human action, says Jef Vizentin-Bugoni, a Brazilian ecologist at Universidade Federal de Pelota who researched the island's birds with Tarwater. He recalls having his expectations upturned when he arrived on the island in 2017, eager to see Hawaii's famous honeycreepers, a set of brightly coloured [native bird species that exist](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211010785) nowhere else in the world. Instead, he was first confronted with an unfamiliar flurry of red and white feathers, which turned out to be a red-whiskered bulbul, a bird whose [native range spans from India to Southern China](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/hisc/info/invasive-species-profiles/red-whiskered-bulbul/).
  - "I followed it as it flitted between trees until it stopped to feed on a fruit I immediately recognised – guava, a plant native to Brazil," he says. "That moment captured the essence of what's happening in Hawaii: a South American plant being eaten by an Asian bird on a remote Pacific island."
  - Most of these exotic species arrived in the last century or two and were thrown together more or less at random – some are [escaped pets](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/hisc/info/invasive-species-profiles/jacksons-chameleon/), others [relics from abandoned farms](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/hisc/info/species/invasive-grasses-in-hawaii-and-their-impacts/). Yet unlike urban environments where foxes and seagulls scratch together a living eating anything they can find, the forests of O'ahu show signs of structure and organisation.

  - Birds that have only lived together for the last century have assumed specialist roles, such as distributing the seeds of native plants, that were once performed by now extinct birds. [In a 2019 study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau8751), Tarwater and Vizentin-Bugoni analysed the eating patterns of birds and seed dispersal on the island to see how they compared to a structured and stable native ecosystem that had evolved together over millennia.
  - "If I compare what I'm seeing in O'ahu with what I see in the middle of the Amazon, will the interactions have the same organisation?" asked Vizentin-Bugoni. "To our surprise, the answer was yes."
  - **Human-made ecosystems**
  - -------------------------
  - For the last few decades, ecologists have documented the appearance of "emerging" or "novel ecosystems" like that on O'ahu. Broadly, novel ecosystems can be defined as "autonomous, wild ecosystems that deviate from natural baselines because of human activities", explains ecologist Jens-Christian Svenning, a professor at Aarhus University in Denmark who studies these ecosystems. Novel ecosystems may contain combinations of species never before seen in history: with some native species living alongside other species introduced by humans beyond their historically recorded ranges or driven into new locations by climate change.
  - Humans may also alter the environment itself, creating new habitats by [reshaping the landscape](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x) or altering environmental chemistry. For example, along the coast of the Netherlands, marine ecologist Laura Govers has [documented how](https://www.rug.nl/fse/news/climate-and-nature/20250325-swimwaywaddenmozaiek?lang=en) a system of coastal defences like dams and sea walls, built during the mid-20th Century, has created a series of salty lakes where exotic species have flourished.
  - For the last decade scientists have studied O'ahu as an 'amazing crystal ball' that offers a glimpse of the future of our planet – Jef Vizentin-Bugoni
  - One former shale oil mine between the Scottish cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow left a mountain made of stone, says Eric Higgs, professor of ecology at the University of Victoria in Canada. Over at least a century piles of stone formed a novel ecosystem through natural assembly processes, says Higgs. It is now a specially protected area that [harbours rare plants](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277043838_West_Lothian_Biodiversity_Action_Plan_Oil_Shale_Bings) such as the early purple orchid and the tiny white flowers of the knotted pearlwort.
  - Unlike zoos and botanical gardens, which also contain globe-spanning collages of plants and animals, novel ecosystems like those on O'ahu are not dependent on humans to continually plant and maintain them. They now exist as self-sustaining systems, says Svenning. "These are wild but _changed_ ecosystems," he says. They have passed some critical threshold which means they are unlikely to ever go back to how they were before. "If you removed all people from the planet, Hawaii would be on a different evolutionary ecological trajectory going forward," he says.

  - Researchers studying O'ahu's unusual ecosystem during fieldwork on a site in Kahanahaiki (Credit: Jef Vizentin-Bugoni)
  - However, these figures – like much around "novel ecosystems" – remain highly controversial among ecologists. [Critics argue that](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534714001578) scientists often cannot clearly define when a threshold of novelty has been passed. There are plenty of cases that are "kind of borderline", says Svenning. For example, power plants in [Florida](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240328-floridas-manatees-are-hooked-on-power-plants) and [Japan](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0232065) are venting warm water that has created tropical microenvironments with an abundance and variety of species not seen in the surrounding cooler waters.
  - "They don't depend on direct active management," like zoos, Svenning says. "But they still rely on ongoing human activity to be there, right?"
  - **Hawaii's nature laboratory**


  - For the last decade, says Vizentin-Bugoni, scientists have studied O'ahu as an "amazing crystal ball" that offers a glimpse of the future of our planet if humans continue to damage environments and drive species to extinction.
  - For millions of years, the remote location of the Hawaiian archipelago, some 2,000 miles (3,200km) from its nearest neighbour (the US mainland), made it a petri dish for the emergence of unique species. After the islands first emerged from the ocean as lifeless rocks [erupting from volcanoes between 30 million](https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo/evolution-hawaiian-volcanoes) and [500,000 years ago](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10865/chapter/5#8), plants and animals arrived there extremely rarely. Migrating birds were the exception, along with the seeds they deposited in their droppings.
  - Hawaii's plants and the birds that remained there therefore evolved largely in isolation from the rest of the world, leading to the evolution of species found nowhere else on the planet, from "flightless ibises to bird-hunting owls", writes anthropologist Todd Braje in his 2024 book [Understanding Imperiled Earth](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/blogs/smithsonian-books/2024/03/07/the-disappearing-birds-of-hawaii/). Without any mammals or large predators of any kind, unique birds evolved to fill diverse niches, like the moa-nalo, (or "flightless megaducks", as Braje calls them) that grew to 2ft (0.6m) in height and helped to disperse large seeds and cycle nutrients on the islands.
  - We like to think of O'ahu as the cautionary tale for all the other Pacific Islands and the Hawaiian Islands. It's what you don't want to have happen – Corey Tarwater
  - Of the 142 species of bird that evolved to live on Hawaii and nowhere else on the planet, 95 are now extinct, including the moa-nalo, according to [the American Bird Conservancy](https://abcbirds.org/program/hawaii/). Similar trends among plants and invertebrates have earned it the label of the "[extinction capital of the world](https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2023/12/14/23990382/extinction-capital-hawaii-endangered-species-act)".
  - Hawaii's islands are a "microcosm" of the issues countries worldwide face from exotic species, according to [2020 research](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3309&context=icwdm_usdanwrc) led by Liba Pejchar, a conservation scientist at the University of Colorado. The arrival of humans – first small groups of Polynesian sailors around 1,000 years ago, later Europeans in 1778 – resulted in forest clearances and the introduction of rats, dogs and cows. For birds, the greatest threat today is the mosquito, which since the 1800s has spread avian malaria that can [kill native birds with a single bite](https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/climate-warms-hawaiian-forest-birds-lose-more-ground-mosquitoes).
  - "We like to think of O'ahu as the cautionary tale for all the other Pacific Islands and the Hawaiian Islands," says Tarwater. "It's what you don't want to have happen."

  - Unsurprisingly, when Tarwater began meticulously tagging Hawaiian birds, non-native species had a bad rap. "When we first started working out on O'ahu, we were asked by people why we didn't just shoot the \[non-native\] birds," says Tarwater. But by instead observing them, her and Vizentin-Bugoni's team discovered that several of the last native fruiting plants, such as the violet berried uki'uki which clings on in pockets high up the mountains, are wholly dependent on non-native birds to disperse seeds.
  - "It was shocking to us that they were just so embedded into these systems," says Tarwater. Still, it's a "double-edged sword", she says. "Unfortunately, they also disperse our non-native plants," she says – which can, in turn, crowd out the endangered natives.
  - During a decade investigating the rich networks that have self-assembled here, both Tarwater and Vizentin-Bugoni have been amazed to find the extent to which ecosystems have meshed together. In [a 2020 paper,](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2435.13670) Tarwater showed that the traits and bodies of non-native birds have shifted in areas they have invaded – some, for example, have smaller bills, better for eating O'ahu's smaller fruits. On O'ahu you can now watch mysterious flocks of numerous species take off together in search of fruit. This behaviour is also seen in the Amazon, but in O'ahu the flocks are made up of birds from all around the planet, from the Himalayas to South America.
  - **'Unrestorable' ecosystems**

  
  - For the profoundly and irreversibly changed environments we see in O'ahu, the most intuitive name might have come not from a scientist at all but from Higgs' young daughter: she has dubbed them "freakosystems", he says. Since these strange places [began to gain recognition in the late 1990s](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oekom/gaia/2024/00000033/00000001/art00007;jsessionid=7jr5ndf4jpjp1.x-ic-live-02), the biggest question has been what environmentalists should do about them.
  - Invasive species
  - Deliberately and accidentally, humans have introduced countless species of animals, plants and other organisms to non-native biomes. While most new additions are innocuous, more than 37,000 species have been found to harm native species, habitats and ecosystems, causing them to be labelled invasive, according to the United Nations' [Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/five-drivers-nature-crisis) (IPBES).
  - Globally, invasive non-native species are one of the top five drivers of global biodiversity loss, according to IPBES, contributing to 60% of global extinctions and causing damages worth [$423bn (£323bn) per year](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/09/invasive-species-cost-global-economy-billions/).
  - Restoration ecologists have been on the frontlines of answering this question, says Higgs. Traditionally, these scientists have aimed to recover degraded landscapes towards some reference point – often, in the Americas, this was set about the time that European colonies began arising in the Americas. The idea was to restore ecosystems to a pre-disturbance or pre-human state.
  - But in many places – including islands like Hawaii and New Zealand, where so many species of plants and animals have gone extinct and non-native species have spread so far – turning back the clock was clearly impossible. This idea of "practical unrestorability" became the hallmark of what a novel ecosystem is, says Higgs.
  - Faced with these challenges, ecologists began to question how useful it would be to follow traditional conservation strategies, such as eradicating non-native "invasive" species – typically defined as an introduced species that harms its new environment. But it is not always easy, in much-changed environments, to identify which species these are.

  - A researcher removes a caught bird from mistnet on O'ahu (Credit: Jef Vizentin-Bugoni)
  - Take, for example, the packs of feral donkeys or "burros" that roam the American South and Australia, the descendants of working animals once used widely in mines and mills that were turned loose decades ago. In places where feral donkeys and horses have competed with native herbivores and overgrazed plants, some local governments have [resorted to large-scale culls](https://nt.gov.au/environment/animals/feral-animals/feral-donkey).
  - But research has shown that donkeys also dig water holes–known as wells or "ass holes" – in many cases providing the [only water source in drylands where temperatures can reach almost 50C](https://theconversation.com/feral-desert-donkeys-are-digging-wells-giving-water-to-parched-wildlife-159909) (122F). In the Sonoran Desert, which spans the US and Northern Mexico, these holes support more than 50 other species, including birds and large native mammals such as mule deer. Mountain lions have even been observed [eating donkeys](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2656.13766).
  - Yet for nature lovers brought up to value pristine environments, and having long ago learned of the destruction wrought by invasive [black rats](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989415000244) or [cane toads](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1657), novel ecosystems challenge many of the fundamental values that have [driven conservation for decades](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/110267). In 2011, when the writer Emma Marris published the influential book Rambunctious Garden, which explored novel ecosystems, critics [responded that she was giving permission to "trash nature"](https://ensia.com/voices/novel-ecosystems-are-a-trojan-horse-for-conservation/). Like Marris, many urban communities have come to love novel environments that have arisen in their local neighbourhoods. Mount Sutro, for example, a forest of non-native eucalyptus, has become [a much-loved park](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/sutro-forest_n_2729240) in San Francisco, says Higgs.
  - As climate change and nature-loss continue, ecologists are adapting their language to acknowledge that many ecosystems have "novel elements" or degrees of "ecological novelty". A new map [published by researchers in March 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-025-02662-2), tracked how ecosystems across the planet were being changed by climate change, the loss of key animals and native plants being replaced by invasive species. Matthew Kerr, a researcher in Svenning's lab at Aarhus University who made the map, says he found that novel habitats are now truly global, with more than half of the earth's land highly changed: "This extended out to protected areas," he says, including nature parks and marine reserves.
  - **Discovering what works**
  - --------------------------
  - O'ahu, at least, is teaching us important lessons that can help protect other environments not yet so degraded, including other islands where native ecosystems remain healthier, says Vizentin-Bugoni. Research has spotlighted certain species that set alarm bells ringing, as they are most likely to do harm to surrounding ecosystems.
  - ![](https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png)![Jef Vizentin-Bugoni Fruits can be collected on O'ahu which originate from all over the world (Credit: Jef Vizentin-Bugoni)](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l27q1q.jpg.webp)Jef Vizentin-Bugoni
  - Fruits can be collected on O'ahu which originate from all over the world (Credit: Jef Vizentin-Bugoni)
  - "For the plants, the ones that are most likely to be a problem are the ones that fruit for a long period and also have small seeds," he says. Both these characteristics increase the chance of being eaten by birds and spread around rapidly.
  - On O'ahu itself, research into novel ecosystems is guiding more unconventional conservation strategies. Most land managers are aiming to safeguard [the 87% of native plants threatened with extinction](https://iucn.org/news/species/201609/four-out-six-great-apes-one-step-away-extinction-%E2%80%93-iucn-red-list) by meticulously removing invasive plant species from "these tiny restoration sites", explains Tarwater. Although this allows native plants to grow without competition, these [denuded areas quickly become bird-free zones](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378112722002614#:~:text=The%20removal%20of%20non%2Dnative%20species%20is%20a%20critical%20conservation,et%20al.%2C%202002\).), she says. "There's not enough fruit in those areas to attract them there, which isn't good \[for native plants\], if those are the only things left to disperse their fruits."
  - To get the birds to spread native plants around, the team in O'ahu instead try to trick them. They [use speakers to play the calls](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.1963) of "birds that we know are really good seed dispersers" to lure them to restoration sites where native plants remained, Tarwater says. "Once they're there, they're like: 'Oh, hey, look at that fruit!' and they'll eat it." (Read about [how scientists coax back species with sound in other parts of the world too](https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20230519-the-sound-recordings-used-to-coax-back-species).)
  - Such strategies work with non-native birds to help conserve the tiny patches of remaining native plants – although many roles, such as the moa-nalos' dispersal of large seeds, are still not filled, as no non-native species are big enough.
  - It all makes unravelling what to do with these novel habitats difficult. "It's complex and depends on the goals of restoration," says Tarwater. A conservationist focusing on native plants may eradicate as many non-native competitors as possible, she says. "But if you're interested in conserving a native snail or some of these other species, that \[non-native plant\] might be the habitat that they currently rely upon."
  - While novel ecosystems remain controversial, on O'ahu, conservationists and land managers have become less black-and-white about native and non-native species, says Tarwater.
  - "We know that the challenges of the novel ecosystems are going to remain, and likely increase. We know that it's not as simple as them being good or bad."

### [It’s Always the Other Side That’s Been Brainwashed | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/04/07/its-always-the-other-side-thats-been-brainwashed)

  - Propaganda 
  - It’s Always the Other Side That’s Been Brainwashed | The New Yorker
  - It wasn’t so long ago that respectable psychologists didn’t really talk about “brainwashing.” The term had the slightly kitschy flavor of other Cold War embarrassments—[C.I.A.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/10/10/has-the-cia-done-more-harm-than-good) spy cats and [Reds-under-the-bed paranoia](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/03/17/red-scare-clay-risen-book-review). But Google’s indispensable Ngram Viewer, which analyzes how frequently phrases appear in printed texts, confirms that the past two decades have seen an uptick in the word’s usage. What’s bringing brainwashing back?
  - One potential answer is the rise of technologies suspected of having mind-controlling powers, chief among them [social media](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/we-know-less-about-social-media-than-we-think). Another is the entrenched political polarization of our time. When the cousin you kicked a soccer ball around with as a [child](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/03/03/the-population-implosion) starts spouting unhinged certainties about viruses, vaccines, and climate change—beliefs he treats as beyond debate—you might wonder: _What happened to him?_ This isn’t just an ordinary disagreement. Could he have been . . . brainwashed?
  - Don’t get smug; he’s wondering the same thing about you. A few years ago, _Psychology Today_ posted a checklist under the headline “Your Friend Might Be Politically Brainwashed If . . .” The last item on the list: “They assume that everyone who disagrees with them must be brainwashed.” So wait—does entertaining the possibility of having been brainwashed mean that you haven’t been? Or is that too easy?
  - Several recent books have taken up the subject of brainwashing—among them Daniel Pick’s “[Brainwashed: A New History of Thought Control](https://www.amazon.com/Brainwashed-History-Thought-Control-Wellcome-ebook/dp/B01MZC0D6I/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3PLMG0FMOG2V7&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6py3LW6K6yAoZgwThAD81kW3eKzxwtK74G2f7MHeR8jGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.HcQNUo5cx4Niem6ub3498PZYS0qM4rAYfpKdVGDmgG8&dib_tag=se&keywords=Brainwashed:%20A%20New%20History%20of%20Thought%20Control&qid=1743434256&s=audible&sprefix=,audible,115&sr=1-1)” (Profile), Joel E. Dimsdale’s “[Dark Persuasion: A History of Brainwashing from Pavlov to Social Media](https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Persuasion-History-Brainwashing-Pavlov/dp/0300247176/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.8DYoWnxNyjZJ_ft46UD4Nw.tMHEECgb3fY7b0N_L1uiXH-ll1_V2qGKSY_Zn2RZ9sI&qid=1743434154&sr=8-1)” (Yale), and Andreas Killen’s “[Nervous Systems: Brain Science in the Early Cold War](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-War-Brain-Andreas-Killen/dp/0062572652/ref=sr_1_1?crid=71APKIHRMFC3&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.17RJU0Pdvy_VS5TAhUYKJOjt9Rqe6dcclFlmSit6orY.znsMyEilt68_v7YCbKEj9Bg2eLXRtTa-2T7Fzu4p8po&dib_tag=se&keywords=nervous%20systems%20andreas%20killens&qid=1743434237&s=audible&sprefix=nervous%20systems%20andreas%20killens,audible,105&sr=1-1)” (HarperCollins). They share a scholarly squeamishness about the word they are forced to use for their subject matter. “Yes, the term _brainwashing_ is silly and unscientific,” Dimsdale writes. “No one ever meant it literally, but the metaphor is a powerful one.”
  - In the new book “[The Instability of Truth: Brainwashing, Mind Control, and Hyper-Persuasion](https://www.amazon.com/Instability-Truth-Brainwashing-Control-Hyper-Persuasion/dp/1324075260/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4yGIuMJ-iqj7AZpOgUzUMsxmpULDcdN6x5ShjbvCqiQ.nxZEogz3xrI7mqcjP1pJRIbRyO-t-KB5fPJFpvlCtd4&qid=1743434274&sr=1-1)” (Norton), Rebecca Lemov, a historian of science at Harvard, takes a different approach. She is often asked, she says, whether brainwashing really exists. “The answer is yes,” she writes, without any it-depends-what-you-mean-by hedging. In fact, she continues, “what we call brainwashing is not rare but common.”
  - Of course, words like “brainwashing” have no fixed meaning independent of their usage, which can be imprecise and expansive. When [Frantz Fanon](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/06/frantz-fanons-enduring-legacy) wrote of colonial efforts at _lavage de cerveau_ in Algeria, or when a commentator in the seventies accused President Richard Nixon of having “brainwashed” white workers into fearing Communist infiltration, the word was gesturing at _something_, however loosely defined.
  - Yet the term’s recent resurgence raises suspicions. Accusations of brainwashing aren’t neutral claims; they offer a particular explanation for why someone holds beliefs we find preposterous. That explanation attributes those beliefs to deliberate manipulation instead of rational argument or personal conviction. In doing so, it may recast those with “deplorable” beliefs as victims rather than agents, deserving of not just condemnation but sympathy—and, perhaps, treatment. In the seventies heyday of the cults, that treatment was called “deprogramming.” Is this what our addled cousins need? A systematic re-indoctrination into conventionality?
  - The earliest appearances of the concept “brainwashing,” Lemov writes, occurred in the mid-twentieth century, in the files of the Office of Strategic Services, a precursor of the C.I.A. The term came to prominence owing in large part to the writings of an American journalist named Edward Hunter. He claimed that it was a rendering of a Chinese phrase, but it may have been, as he elsewhere claimed, a coinage of his own to describe Chinese persuasion techniques.
  - These techniques were most famously applied during the Korean War. As a prisoner of war, Morris R. Wills faced a gamut of privations—he was left malnourished and consigned to filthy conditions amid the ever-present threat of execution. Horror alternated with boredom. Conditions improved when Wills was transferred to what was called Camp One. The food got better, letters could be sent home, and there were even volleyball games.
  - That was, it seems, an early stage of a procedure known as reëducation. Wills was identified as a member of the exploited classes, a promising target for the method. Reflecting on his experiences many years later, he said, “Brainwashing is not done with electrodes stuck to your head.” It was, rather, “a long, horrible process by which a man slowly—step by step, idea by idea—becomes totally convinced, as I was, that the [Chinese Communists](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/after-a-hundred-years-what-has-chinas-communist-party-learned) have unlocked the secret to man’s happiness and that the United States is run by rich bankers, McCarthy types, and ‘imperialist aggressors.’ ”
  - The theory behind this method, as articulated by Chairman Mao, didn’t sound so bad. People could not be forced to become Marxists, Mao wrote. He recommended, instead, “democratic” methods of “discussion, criticism, persuasion, and education.” An important stage of the process was called “speaking bitterness.” American G.I.s, like the Chinese peasants on whom the method had first been tried, had a great deal of bitterness to speak: of racism and poverty back home, and of discrimination within the armed forces. Wills was made to introspect, to write an autobiography. He and other P.O.W.s were subjected to hours of lectures on Marxist theory.
  - Faced with the demand to justify “the American system,” Wills—unable to articulate what that even was—found himself moving in what his captors called a Progressive (as opposed to Reactionary) direction. American society was rotting, he came to believe; the Chinese way was the future. He chose not to be repatriated. But, where other prisoners who made the same decision were sent to work on farms and in paper mills, he was sent to the People’s University in Beijing.
  - The brainwashing process was never complete. Ostentatious acts of “repentance” were repeatedly demanded—Wills had already had to participate in “self-criticism” seminars. He was now taught more about [Marxism](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/karl-marx-yesterday-and-today) and the history of China. He even witnessed a public execution. But he ended up staying in China for twelve years.
  - Wills’s retrospective accounts of his experience, once he was back in the United States and in a position to reflect on what had been done to him, are illuminating. It is plain that his Chinese captors had succeeded, at least for a time, in producing a genuine change of mind. He was, as he himself put it, “totally convinced.”
  - If we take Wills at his word, we might wonder about Mao’s claim that nobody can be coerced into sincere belief. In professing this, Mao echoes an old idea within modern European thought, one given its most influential expression in John Locke’s 1689 tract, “[A Letter Concerning Toleration](https://www.amazon.com/Letter-Concerning-Toleration-Hackett-Classics/dp/091514560X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1UCTBWDOOPRWD&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.5UknXXoxoSP3xxXGMb_yuSMm-CN6ng50c-XzTU-8XLxSMU9WASxKS2kVe7IstaWvrVRdtk462kdLagWDBuTYAmxY_r4uIZOVuD1j_QM4iuiMVuKWRAXs9lHIghjiO_4ZNtibk-DBHLKjo7EcG_310iQf5TFQpxoc4wBiXM9JJQQh-gfjulXbFzFRi3obUithtj4E9Gq8jH3wEzH23H1W9Gl-nK3bIev341Sniw4njTg.JSvvbVF8TRZJfm1wZdMj0FlFC62c7bjxxjRuspUmtL8&dib_tag=se&keywords=A%20Letter%20Concerning%20Toleration&qid=1743434467&s=books&sprefix=a%20letter%20concerning%20toleration,stripbooks,158&sr=1-1).” Locke condemned the use of coercion in matters of faith—the sort of thing we now associate with the Spanish Inquisitors—and among his arguments was that it simply _couldn’t_ work. Real belief is a product of the “inward persuasion of the mind,” he wrote. An effective torturer can make his victims move their limbs as he tells them to, or even say the words—professions of faith, confessions of guilt—that he whispers into their ears. But “such is the nature of the understanding, that it cannot be compelled to the belief of anything by outward force.”
  - Locke’s point is connected to a more general philosophical claim about belief: that no one can just _decide_ to believe something. Try believing, for instance, that the magazine (or computer or tablet or phone) in front of you is a venomous snake, or that your coffee mug is made of molten lava. You can cry out, if you like, but your steady heart rate will give you away.
  - For all that, you can surely be forced into situations where the desired conviction comes unbidden. Even in the seventeenth century, people saw the limitations of Locke’s view. An Oxford churchman named Jonas Proast agreed that belief could not be coerced directly, but, in his chilling words, the magistrate might lay “such Penalties upon those who refuse to embrace their Doctrine . . . as may make them _bethink_ themselves.”
  - To force someone to believe something requires the concealment of the role that force has played in the process. The brainwashed can’t conceive of themselves as brainwashed; to do so would indicate that the brain remains unwashed. They can only coherently describe their experience as one of seeing the light, having their consciousness raised, being red-pilled. As Lemov quotes someone telling her about brainwashing: if the method works, it “erases itself.”
  - So, if your environment was tailored to exclude alternative views, should we say that you were being forced to believe something? Whether we call this coerced belief is a matter of terminological preference. Ways of making people believe things don’t divide neatly into the persuasive and the coercive—the brainwashing model gives the lie to that distinction. As Lemov writes, echoing the psychologist Edgar Schein, it is “neither pure persuasion nor sheer coercion but both: coercive persuasion.”
  - The phrase “coercive persuasion” effectively conveys the core objection to what it describes. It suppresses the fundamental exercise of human autonomy—it prevents you from making up your own mind. If that’s the case, would the criminal courts find you responsible for what you do when you’ve been brainwashed?
  - This question was decisively answered during the trial of Patricia (Patty) Hearst, in 1976. Two years earlier, Hearst, a granddaughter of the press magnate William Randolph Hearst, was an undergraduate at Berkeley. Her life changed forever when she caught the eyes of members of the Symbionese Liberation Army, an anti-capitalist guerrilla group. They abducted her and held her in a closet, blindfolded, for nearly two months. She was raped multiple times by the group’s leaders while in captivity, having been told that it would be “uncomradely” to refuse consent.
  - Shortly afterward, she was offered a nominal choice. Would she join them? Or did she wish to be freed? It was clear to her that the appearance of choice was illusory, that she was choosing between joining the group and being killed. She chose life. Or, as she later put it, “I accommodated my thoughts to coincide with theirs.” As with the Korean War P.O.W.s before her, mere pretense was not, under the circumstances, a real option. “By the time they had finished with me,” she later reflected, “I was, in fact, a soldier in the Symbionese Liberation Army.”

  - A little more than two months after her abduction, surveillance cameras captured Hearst robbing a bank in San Francisco, gun in hand. When she was eventually arrested, she weighed eighty-seven pounds and was—in the assessment of the psychologist Margaret Singer—“a low-I.Q., low-affect zombie.” The Yale psychiatrist [Robert Jay Lifton](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/how-to-maintain-hope-in-an-age-of-catastrophe) interviewed Hearst for about fifteen hours and then declared her a “classic case” of brainwashing. During her time in custody, she repudiated her allegiance to the S.L.A. When she stood trial for her role in the bank robbery, her attorneys argued that she was a victim of coercion and duress.
  - It was a risky strategy. “I was brainwashed” was not a legally recognized defense. As Lemov, recounting the episode, points out, one of the psychiatrists who testified as an expert witness for the defense did Hearst no favors by admitting blithely that “brainwashing” was not a term of “any medical significance.” It had become, he said, “a sort of a grab bag to describe any kind of influence exerted by a captor over a captive, but that isn’t very accurate from the scientific or the medical point of view.”
  - The defense failed. Patty Hearst was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison. After she had completed nearly two, President Jimmy Carter commuted the sentence to “time served.” It was only on [Bill Clinton](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/09/18/the-wanderer-bill-clinton-profile-david-remnick)’s last day in office, in 2001, that she received a full pardon.
  - Why, Lemov asks, have lawyers found brainwashing “impossible to deploy as a legal exculpatory framework”? The concept evidently places defense lawyers in a double bind. If brainwashing doesn’t work, defendants can hardly claim it as a defense. But, if it does work, the defendants are acting on their own beliefs and no longer being coerced. An NPR interviewer forty years after the Hearst trial put the question in a revealing way: “Was she coerced, or did she become a believer?” Lemov rightly asks why it couldn’t be both. Why not say that “Hearst was coerced into becoming a true believer”?
  - The problem, as Lemov sees it, is that our intuitive model for thinking about brainwashing diagnoses it as a “rational, cognitive malfunction.” Hence the mockery to which the brainwashed are frequently subjected. The brainwashed soldiers of the Korean War were thought of as hapless dupes who “fell for” Communism, Lemov says. She invites us to consider a twenty-first-century parallel: the scorn directed at people who lose their savings to a [cryptocurrency](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/cryptocurrency) cult.
  - Lemov thinks that this perception shifts once we acknowledge the role of trauma in brainwashing. Maybe so. But how does this claim square with her broader hypothesis that “what we call brainwashing is not rare but common”? If trauma is a necessary condition for brainwashing, as she suggests, it follows that trauma is more widespread than we might assume. Yet she insists that she is not among the credulous sentimentalists who “see trauma everywhere.” How common, then, is brainwashing?
  - For recent historians of brainwashing, the issue carries high contemporary stakes. Joel Dimsdale, in “Dark Persuasion,” relates the disturbing case of Alexander Urtula, who took his life after receiving a staggering forty-seven thousand text messages from his girlfriend, who kept urging him to do so. Dimsdale asks, “If you can use social media to persuade an individual you know well to do something awful, can you persuade a wider circle of friends and acquaintances?” Given the resources—for instance, “troll farms” of the kind that state actors can muster—it appears that you sometimes can.
  - The power of such trolls lies in their ability to manipulate the epistemic environment. What was once a lone voice ranting at a street corner becomes a mutually reinforcing chorus. “When observers receive the same message from multiple sources,” Dimsdale writes, “they find the messages more believable, even if they are preposterous.” When President Trump tells us that “a lot of people are saying . . . ,” this claim, at least, is true.
  - There was outrage when it was revealed that [Facebook](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/19/why-facebook-cant-fix-itself) researchers were tinkering with users’ emotions—making tiny tweaks to their feeds in what Lemov calls “massive-scale emotional engineering.” But she notes that the backlash didn’t stop the researchers from running these experiments; it just made them more reticent about their results. One researcher on the project said that the response amounted to people thinking, “You can’t mess with my emotions. It’s like messing with me. It’s mind control.”
  - And, in a sense, it _is_ mind control. But that phrase, much like “brainwashing,” runs into a tricky question: Isn’t everything that shapes our thoughts, desires, or feelings a form of mind control? Lurking behind our unease is a fantasy of total, unshackled cognitive freedom. Any deviation from that ideal gets labelled as manipulation. If we cling to that standard, then, sure, we’re all brainwashed. But the standard is an absurdity. It’s obvious that our minds are shaped by the world we live in, including what others say. This isn’t what we have in mind when we talk about mind control.
  - Our idea, instead, is that to be free is not to be subject to the will of another. Lemov quotes an impassioned remark made by the Princeton sociologist [Zeynep Tufekci](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/innovation-dial-up-on-the-bosphorus) about how online corporate power enlists “new tools and stealth methods to quietly model our personality, our vulnerabilities, identify our networks, and effectively nudge and shape our ideas, desires and dreams.” That’s the real worry these days—not just influence but control that’s hidden and personal.
  - Lemov’s emphasis on trauma suggests that the concept of brainwashing may not be all that helpful in understanding whatever it is that social media does to its users. Morris Wills was starved and terrified as a P.O.W. Patty Hearst was locked in a closet and sexually assaulted. Contemporary sociology invites us, perhaps rightly, to extend the traditional concept to include the working-class experience of deindustrialization and the precarity of the white-collar knowledge worker denied a secure job. The question still arises: What has your average [TikTok](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-happened-when-an-extremely-offline-person-tried-tiktok) user been subjected to that is remotely comparable to what Wills and Hearst endured?
  - There’s another irony here. Much of what Wills came to believe when he lived in China—that socialism is superior to capitalism, that the United States is an imperialist power run by a class of kleptocratic oligarchs—is shared by many young people today who were subjected to nothing more traumatic than a typical liberal-arts education. Their professors would, of course, balk at the implication that they’ve brainwashed their students, but that’s exactly what their critics in the conservative media have long been accusing them of.
  - It’s a familiar pattern in our polarized age. The right accuses the left of using the institutions it dominates—the federal bureaucracy, nonprofits, universities, Hollywood, and “legacy” media—to brainwash the public. The left, in turn, levels the same charge against the right, pointing to talk radio, partisan television networks, and manosphere podcasts. (Each side condemns the other’s social-media activity.) Naturally, no one admits to doing what they denounce in their opponents. But that’s to be expected: persuasion is what we do; brainwashing is what they do.
  - Does the case of the radical professor fit into this model of malign manipulation? Come to think of it, what exactly should we make of the Communists who brainwashed the American soldiers? Or the members of the Symbionese Liberation Army—mainly white, middle-class, and well educated—who appeared quite sincerely to believe their rhetoric calling for “death to the fascist insect that preys upon the life of the people”? Were _they_ brainwashed into their beliefs, too? Or did they form them in the way that we all do—as the result of some half-conscious process only half mindful of evidence and truth?
  - We can grant that the term “brainwashing” has some utility as an explanation for what happened to certain individuals who were subjected to extraordinary stress and strenuous efforts at reëducation. But we needn’t reach for it when we seek to describe, and understand, the masses of people who fail to see what we find clear-cut. There are simply too many other ways of making sense of their beliefs.
  - Heterodox views—particularly antinomian ones—are attractive in part because they are at odds with the obvious. If our beliefs were obvious, how could we use them to distinguish our group from others? How could our beliefs be used to demarcate a social identity? Even in more mainstream precincts, plenty of our avowed beliefs—“our diversity is our strength”—may not be real beliefs at all, if belief is something that holds itself accountable to fact. In ways the philosopher Daniel Williams has explored, they are better understood as shibboleths, tribal anthems, expressions of commitment so deep that we cannot conceive of doubting them. Insofar as these clichés don’t express factual propositions, we shouldn’t apply to them the explanatory frameworks designed to tell us how people come to credit outlandish things.
  - We may be better served by looking to more conventional human motivations: our desire for approval from those around us, and the way social incentives can reward the outrageous and punish the reasonable. Social media strengthens these tendencies by indulging them and allowing them to operate on an unprecedented scope. Ordinary forces working on a vast scale often produce the effect of an extraordinary force.
  - Although beliefs can be badges—tribal markers chosen less for their empirical accuracy than for what they signal about us—plenty of people do buy into outlandish factual views. It’s not a cope, or a flex; it’s what they take to be reality. How about them?
  - There’s a well-meaning, if patronizing, ethical impulse behind our propensity to blame brainwashing for others’ convictions, whether they’re expressions of allegiance, hard factual commitments, or something in between. Labelling people as brainwashed casts them as one of the damned—lost souls whom we, as saviors, must redeem. Yet it might be our own savior complexes that we need to shed.
  - The philosopher [Karl Popper](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/04/01/the-porcupine), writing in 1960, suggested that the temptation to attribute misguided beliefs to sinister manipulation came from a mistaken assumption: that “truth is manifest.” If the truth were manifest, it would follow that the failure to grasp it must reflect “the work of powers conspiring to keep us in ignorance, to poison our minds by filling them with falsehood.”
  - But, even when confronted with a world of people holding views we find baffling, why assume that they’re victims of a grand conspiracy—or victims at all? Perhaps truth isn’t so obvious. Uncovering it demands effort and a bit of luck. Other people will take different things to be true because their paths—owing to differences in diligence or chance—diverged from ours. That conspiracy-minded cousin isn’t necessarily a casualty of mind control; he may simply have wandered down intellectual rabbit holes where evidence matters less than belonging. To depict him as a victim of manipulation grants him an unearned absolution. The most disturbing possibility isn’t that millions have been brainwashed. It’s that they haven’t. ♦

  - As I think about embracing authenticity and imperfection—both in life and in art—the metaphor I keep coming back to is kintsugi, which translates to “golden joinery.” Kintsugi is the centuries-old Japanese art of mending broken ceramics with gold. You’ve probably seen examples, either up close or in photos: ceramic bowls repaired with gold; depending on where the breaks occurred, they almost look veined with it.
  - The artist doesn’t hide the cracks, but fills them with lacquer dusted with powdered gold, silver, or platinum, so that it gleams where it was pieced back together. The artist honors the object’s history—what it went through to become what it is now, including being broken. And the artist gives the object new life.
  - So what does it mean to honor the history of a piece of writing? If you’re like me, your poem or essay might go through anywhere from two to two hundred drafts before you’re satisfied enough with it to call it “done” and send it out. Each revision, ideally, gets us closer to the piece we sense is there, waiting. The piece that will do the psychic or spiritual work we want it to do. But each revision can also pull us farther away from the initial spark that drove us to the page. This tension, this push and pull, is what makes revision dynamic and exciting: we’re hunting something but aren’t quite clear about what it looks like or how to find it.
  - When I think about accepting the gift our poems give us in the guise of error, I think of the advice that we Midwesterners know all too well about driving in ice and snow: Steer into the skid, not out of it.
  - We can honor the object’s history by allowing the process to show. In this way, the break isn’t something that happened after the piece was finished—after the bowl was formed and fired and glazed. The breaking is part of the writing process, part of the story of the object being made. Maybe the piece of writing wasn’t finished, not fully itself, until the break.
  - Article continues after advertisement
  - We often say, “make it or break it.” I’m on the side of “make it and break it.” Or make it by letting it break and seeing what might come of it.
  - Perhaps kintsugi in writing is when the writer makes a mistake but decides to keep it, and in fact calls attention to it, leaning into the mistakes—mishearings, misreadings, misunderstandings, even typos—and filling the breaks with gold. The error—if we may call it an error—leads to new insights, layers of meaning, or exciting associative leaps that make the poem more of itself, not less than. The mistake, in fact, is a gift. The break, or breakdown, allows for a breakthrough.
  - “Written Deer” from _Goldenrod_ is one example. I was reading poems by Wisława Szymborska when I came across this line: “Why does this written doe bound through these written woods?” The question made me want to push further into the setting—the written woods—and to consider what it means to both create and experience (or write and read) a place. I draft all of my poems longhand, often writing very quickly, and in my messy half-print, half-cursive handwriting, world and word were almost indistinguishable. As the poem came into focus, this conflation made its way into the poem’s argument. I could have left this error out of the poem, but it led me to consider what these two things have in common: “Either one could be erased.” That stark realization felt important to me, so it’s in the poem.
  - **Written Deer**
  - _Why does this written doe bound through_
  - _these written woods?_
  - Article continues after advertisement
  - —Wisława Szymborska
  - My handwriting is all over these woods.
  - No, my handwriting is these woods,
  - each tree a half-print, half-cursive scrawl,
  - each loop a limb. My house is somewhere
  - here, & I have scribbled myself inside it.
  - What is home but a book we write, then
  - read again & again, each time dog-earing
  - different pages. In the morning I wake
  - in time to pencil the sun high. How
  - fragile it is, the world—I almost wrote
  - Article continues after advertisement
  - _the word_ but caught myself. Either one
  - could be erased. In these written woods,
  - branches smudge around me whenever
  - I take a deep breath. Still, written fawns
  - lie in the written sunlight that dapples
  - their backs. What is home but a passage
  - I’m writing & underlining every time I read it.
  - Sometimes miswriting or mistyping a word can lead to a new insight that wasn’t accessible before. What may seem like a mistake may in fact be the most important point in the poem, the place where the poet discovers new territory. Or the part where the poem introduces the poet to its subject.
  - “How Killer Blue Irises Spread” by Kelli Russell Agodon was inspired by a misheard health report on NPR. The story behind the poem is this: A poet, also the mother of a young girl at the time, was listening to NPR and misheard the title of an upcoming segment. She thought she heard the announcer say “How Killer Blue Irises Spread” and panicked, worrying because there were blue irises growing in their garden, where her daughter played. The NPR segment was actually “How Killer Flu Viruses Spread”—but Agodon leaned into the misunderstanding and tried to imagine all the ways that blue irises could be dangerous or actual killers, and we see these imaginative leaps in the poem. This sense of play—the pleasure the poet had writing this piece—would not have been possible without the error.
  - Article continues after advertisement
  - When I think about accepting the gift our poems give us in the guise of error, I think of the advice that we Midwesterners know all too well about driving in ice and snow: Steer into the skid, not out of it. To keep from losing control you have to turn in the direction you’re sliding, even though you desperately want to wrench yourself in the opposite direction. In this poem, Agodon steers into the skid.
  - A poem is not only a temporal experience but a human experience—and we are imperfect. By allowing imperfection into our poems—by letting some of the breaks and repairs show—we are also allowing our humanity into our poems, and allowing for a different kind of intimacy between the reader and writer. Dylan Thomas wrote, “The best craftsmanship always leaves holes and gaps in the works of the poem so that something that is not in the poem can creep, crawl, flash, or thunder in.”
  - I read poems and essays to witness someone else’s mind at work, and these moments of error or brokenness, these switchbacks, help me see that work. In a sense, the gold that “fixes” the breaks in our work is the very material it is made of: language. And in Thomas’s words, the breaks are openings.
  - Allowing ourselves to falter, to be disoriented, to find a new foothold—that strengthens us, too. And of course all of this applies to living as much as it does to writing. We’re going to make mistakes. Instead of trying to hide the breaks, or revise a piece to “correct” the error and make it impossible to detect, we have another option, as these poems show us.
  - I hope you’ll let some of the seams show in your next piece of writing. I hope you’ll let some of the history remain. Challenge yourself not to buff out every scratch and sand down every splinter. Accept the gifts that arrive packaged as missteps. Acknowledge the breaks and let them shine.

    - The life of the mind may be a deeply personal thing, but as embodied in colleges and universities, it is also a very public thing—and the two go hand in hand. Since taking office, the Trump administration has been working to dismantle the global order and the nation’s core institutions, including its cultural ones, to strip them of their power. The future of the nation’s universities is very much at stake. This is not a challenge that can be met with purely defensive tactics. We must do what should have been done long ago: find our way to a new social contract between universities and the American people.
    - Whatever form it takes, the life of the mind is essential to individual and social flourishing. When I think about its unpredictable byways, I think of my own story. The life of the mind first found me in the third grade on a small elementary-school playground in suburban Southern California, thanks to the work of a schoolyard bully. My family had spent the previous year in France for my father’s sabbatical; now, having returned to my former school, I sought to reestablish my relationship with my best friend. But during my absence, she’d formed a bond with another little girl who was not ready for a trio. This other little girl kicked and scratched and punched to keep me away. I gave up, and developed a habit for the rest of that year of using recess for a solitary walk around the edges of the athletic fields, beneath the border of shade trees. I realized during those walks that a friend who wouldn’t stick up for me wasn’t really a friend, and that friendship should mean something else altogether. That time spent in reflection was liberating—an opportunity for my understanding of the world to ripen.

    - April 14, 2025Updated 2:54 p.m. ET
    - [_Follow live updates on the Trump administration._](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/14/us/trump-news-tariffs)
    - As he finished lunch in the private dining room outside the Oval Office on April 1, President Trump floated an astounding proposal: What if the government simply canceled every dollar of the nearly $9 billion promised to Harvard University?
    - The administration’s campaign to expunge “woke” ideology from college campuses had already forced Columbia University to strike a deal. Now, the White House was eyeing the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university.
    - “What if we never pay them?” Mr. Trump casually asked, according to a person familiar with the conversation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private discussion. “Wouldn’t that be cool?”
    - The moment underscored the aggressive, ad hoc approach continuing to shape one of the new administration’s [most consequential policies](https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html).
    - Mr. Trump and his top aides are exerting control of huge sums of federal research money to shift the ideological tilt of the higher education system, which they see as hostile to conservatives and intent on perpetuating liberalism.
    - Their effort was energized by the campus protests against Israel’s response to the October 2023 terrorist attack by Hamas, demonstrations during which Jewish students were sometimes harassed. Soon after taking office, Mr. Trump opened the Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, which is scrutinizing leading universities for potential civil rights violations and serving as an entry point to pressure schools to reassess their policies.
    - It is backed by the influence of Stephen Miller, who is Mr. Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy and the architect of much of the president’s domestic agenda.
    - The opaque process is upending campuses nationwide, leaving elite institutions, long accustomed to operating with relative freedom from Washington, reeling from a blunt-force political attack that is at the leading edge of a bigger cultural battle.
    - The task force includes about 20 administration officials, most of whom the government has not publicly identified, citing potential security risks. They meet each week inside a rotating list of federal agency headquarters in Washington to discuss reports of discrimination on college campuses, review grants to universities and write up discoveries and recommendations for Mr. Trump.
    - On a parallel track, a few powerful aides in the West Wing, including Mr. Miller, have separately moved to stymie funding for major institutions without formally going through the task force.
    - These aides have spoken privately of toppling a high-profile university to signal their seriousness, said two people familiar with the conversations. And they have already partially suspended research funding for more than twice as many schools as has the task force, according to those familiar with their work.
    - This account of the inner workings of the higher education pressure campaign is based on interviews with more than two dozen senior administration officials, university leaders and outside advisers for both sides. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations or because they feared retribution against their campuses.
    - The White House scored an early win with [Columbia’s capitulation](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/nyregion/columbia-response-trump-demands.html) last month to a list of demands that included tightening disciplinary policies and installing new oversight of the university’s Middle Eastern, South Asian and African studies department.
    - Since then, the Trump administration expanded its focus to six more of the nation’s most exclusive universities, [including Harvard](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/trump-harvard-funding-demands.html).
    - By the time Mr. Trump privately discussed stopping all payments to Harvard, the task force had opened a funding review. That led the administration to send the university a list of demands on Friday, including that it bring in an outsider “to audit those programs and departments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.” The government also insisted that Harvard change hiring and admissions in departments that “lack viewpoint diversity” and “immediately shutter” any programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion.
    - Harvard said on Monday that [it would not acquiesce](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/harvard-trump-reject-demands.html?campaign_id=60&emc=edit_na_20250414&instance_id=152561&nl=breaking-news&regi_id=271771972&segment_id=195992&user_id=f21f60077c4dbe2a090cc19f562fe1df). The university’s president, Alan M. Garber, wrote in [an open letter](https://www.harvard.edu/president/news/2025/the-promise-of-american-higher-education/) that most of the administration’s demands “represent direct governmental regulation of the ‘intellectual conditions’ at Harvard.” The university, Dr. Garber added, “will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
    - In a separate letter, two outside lawyers representing Harvard told administration officials that the university “is not prepared to agree to demands that go beyond the lawful authority of this or any administration.”
    - But the scope of the administration’s campaign is still poised to widen. The Education Department has warned [60 universities](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-sends-letters-60-universities-under-investigation-antisemitic-discrimination-and-harassment) that they could face repercussions from pending investigations into accusations of antisemitism.
    - The push comes as public confidence in higher education has plummeted in the past decade, according to a Gallup [poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/646880/confidence-higher-education-closely-divided.aspx?version=print) in July. The decline was driven mostly by concerns of colleges pushing political agendas, not teaching relevant skills, and the costs, the survey showed.
    - Still, university leaders have been stunned by the swift assault, with no clear sense of how the Trump administration chooses its targets, on what basis it is formulating penalties, or how to push back. Many see the effort as a widespread attack on academic freedom aimed at crushing the influence of higher education.
    - “I’ve never seen this degree of government intrusion, encroachment into academic decision-making — nothing like this,” said Lee C. Bollinger, who spent 21 years as Columbia’s president and more than five years leading the University of Michigan.
    - For their part, Trump administration officials and their allies say they are trying to hold accountable a system that each year receives about [$60 billion](https://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/higher-education-research-development/2023#data) in federal research funds while educating about [15 million](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cha/undergrad-enrollment) undergraduates.
    - “We’re not looking to just file lawsuits — we want to compel a cultural change in how Jewish Americans are treated on college campuses,” Attorney General Pam Bondi, a member of the task force, said in an interview.
    - But the effort has gone beyond addressing antisemitism, with schools targeted for diversity programs and supporting transgender athletes. In the view of some of Mr. Trump’s closest advisers and key donors, leftists have seized control of America’s most powerful institutions, including pillars of higher education, and wresting back power is key to the future of Western civilization.
    - “The universities seem all powerful and they have acted as if they were all powerful, and we’re finally revealing that we can hit that where it hurts,” Christopher F. Rufo, a conservative activist who has championed the strategy, said in an interview.

    - During last year’s presidential campaign, Mr. Trump looked out from his rally stages and described a nation he viewed as rampant with discrimination against conservatives.
    - And for him, nowhere was political injustice as pervasive as on college campuses run by “Marxist maniacs and lunatics.”
    - Weeks after opening his third presidential bid, Mr. Trump had announced a “free speech policy initiative,” [promising](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/president-donald-j-trump-free-speech-policy-initiative) to strip federal research dollars and student loan support from universities involved in what he generalized as “censorship activities or election interferences.”
    - Six months later, he complained about “racial discrimination” in higher education, suggesting universities were increasingly hostile to white students. He vowed to open civil rights investigations into schools that promoted diversity, and he doubled down on those threats when the Supreme Court rejected affirmative action in college admissions.
    - At the same time, Mr. Miller, the longtime Trump adviser, was working on similar issues at America First Legal, the nonprofit he started during the Biden administration. The group has sued New York University and Northwestern University, accusing them of discriminating against white men.
    - Mr. Trump turned more forcefully to combating antisemitism as a political rallying cry after Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants led an attack that killed more than 1,200 people in Israel in what was the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. War in Gaza followed, and so did months of protests, particularly among pro-Palestinian students on college campuses. Thousands [were arrested](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/us/campus-protests-arrests.html) as they occupied presidents’ offices, harassed Jewish students, erected makeshift encampments and disrupted graduation ceremonies.

    - From the campaign trail, Mr. Trump cast the protests in personal terms, claiming that “raging lunatics” were demonstrating on campuses to distract from immigration issues central to his campaign.
    - “To every college president,” Mr. Trump said at a rally in Waukesha, Wis., “vanquish the radicals and take back our campuses for all of the normal students.”

    - The task force to combat antisemitism was announced on Feb. 1, with the stated goal to “eradicate antisemitic harassment in schools and on college campuses.” The exact metrics to measure that progress remain unclear.
    - The administration has declined to identify all members of the group, but its titular head is Leo Terrell, the senior counsel in the Justice Department’s civil rights division. A fixture on social media and Fox News’s “Hannity” show, Mr. Terrell is a Trump favorite.
    - The public face of the task force has largely been Linda McMahon, the education secretary. Other identified members include Josh Gruenbaum, a top official at the General Services Administration, and Sean Keveney, the acting general counsel at the health department.

    - Coordinated through the Justice Department’s civil rights division, the task force also includes officials from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The commission is investigating “dozens” of antisemitism complaints on college campuses that could become part of the task force’s investigation, according to two task force members. The group also includes data specialists, civil rights lawyers and former academics in the government.
    - In February, task force members announced a special focus on 10 universities: Columbia; George Washington University; Harvard; Johns Hopkins University; N.Y.U.; Northwestern; the University of California, Berkeley; the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of Minnesota; and the University of Southern California.
    - The task force said it planned to visit each school and hold meetings with administrators, students, local law enforcement officials and community members.
    - By going after Columbia and Harvard early, the task force set the tone.
    - The goal, one senior administration official said, was to make examples of elite schools to intimidate other universities.
    - The White House also zeroed in on another five schools — Brown University, Cornell University, Northwestern, the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University, according to people familiar with the process.
    - All have had millions in federal funding suspended, threatening projects, laboratories and jobs, and upending a multigenerational pact between the government and universities. Since around World War II, colleges have been at the heart of the American research system.

    - The amount of research funding that has been targeted at each university has varied widely, and there have been few indications of how officials are landing on specific dollar amounts.
    - One task force member said the figures were determined as part of the group’s deliberations, which weighed the volume of grants and contracts promised to a school, the disparities in disciplinary policies, and the institution’s willingness to adopt changes and progress toward those goals.
    - Ultimately, the group recommends to Mr. Trump whether the government should cut funding, as it did before canceling contracts with Columbia last month, according to people familiar with the process.
    - In that case, the task force notified the school on March 3 that it was reviewing grants. Four days later, on March 7, it cited Columbia’s “continued failure to end the persistent harassment of Jewish students” and canceled $400 million in contracts and grants.
    - Ms. McMahon delivered the news in person that day to Katrina Armstrong, who has since left her post as Columbia’s interim president. Soon after, Ms. McMahon said, leaders of schools such as Harvard and Yale scheduled meetings with her.
    - “They wanted to make sure we knew they were reviewing their policies,” Ms. McMahon said in an interview. “The presidents that I’ve spoken to have been very cordial, but very sincere in their effort to make sure that they were doing everything that they needed on their campus to protect students.”
    -  A Scramble to Respond

    - Some universities got wind that their institutions were under scrutiny only when stop-work orders for federally funded research trickled in. On one campus, a faculty member heard from a government program officer that a cut to research money was imminent — a warning that sent campus leaders scrambling.
    - J. Larry Jameson, Penn’s president, said last month that the university learned “through various news outlets” that the Trump administration was suspending about $175 million for research projects. Brown’s provost sent a memo about “troubling rumors” shortly before White House officials said, with little fanfare, that the administration planned to stop $510 million in funding.
    - After The Daily Caller, a conservative media outlet, reported that $210 million in research funding to Princeton was suspended, the university’s president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, wrote in a campus email that “the full rationale for this action is not yet clear.” When The New York Times asked the White House for comment, a spokeswoman replied with a link to a Daily Caller reporter’s social media post and only three words: “This is accurate.”

    - Some school administrators have said that murkiness has complicated considerations of court challenges.
    - They are left feeling in the dark, one university official said.
    - Mr. Eisgruber [wrote in The Atlantic last month](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/columbia-academic-freedom/682088/) that the Trump administration’s moves against Columbia were creating “the greatest threat to American universities since the Red Scare of the 1950s.”
    - “There is a pattern here of intrusions in academic freedom of strong universities that should be of concern to every American,” he said in an [interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/podcasts/the-daily/princeton-university-trump.html) on “The Daily,” a podcast from The Times.
    - In the scramble for self-defense, some university leaders have reached out to Jewish activists to push back on what they view as the administration’s overly broad definition of antisemitism.
    - Other schools have focused on outreach to Mr. Trump through his allies. Harvard hired as a lobbyist Brian Ballard, a former Trump campaign finance chairman whose firm once employed Susie Wiles, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, and Ms. Bondi, the attorney general. Dartmouth installed a former chief counsel at the Republican National Committee as the college’s top lawyer.
    - But it is unclear how much these connections will help. The key staff members on the issue inside the West Wing are Mr. Miller; Vince Haley, the head of the domestic policy council; and May Mailman, senior policy strategist — all three of whom are seen as hard-line culture warriors resistant to lobbying.

    - The administration’s zeal has flummoxed even some close Trump allies concerned that the pressure campaign could set a troubling precedent for future administrations that, for example, decide to “eradicate” sexism from college campuses or bigots from the faculty. Who gets to decide which people fall into what category and when?
    - Inside the White House, such worries are dismissed. That kind of thinking held back the first Trump administration, officials said. They are not concerned about what the political left might do in the future, they said, but instead are focused on setting in motion long-term change.

    - Almost three months into the Trump administration’s war on universities, and a year and a half into the Republican Party’s organized campaign against the presidents of top colleges, it is clear that antisemitism and D.E.I. are mere pretexts for these attacks. Like much of what this administration does, the war on higher education is driven by anti-intellectualism and greed. Trump is building a mafia state, in which the don distributes both money and power. Universities are independent centers of intellectual and, to some extent, political power. He is trying to destroy that independence.
    - There is a way for universities to fight back. It requires more than refusing to bend to Trump’s will, and it requires more than forming a united front. They must abandon all the concerns — rankings, donors, campus amenities — that preoccupy and distract them, and focus on their core mission: the production and dissemination of knowledge. Intellectuals have adopted this strategy to fight against autocrats in other countries. It works.
    - Because Trump views everything as transactional and assumes everyone to be driven by profit, he has approached universities the same way he approached law firms and, arguably, countries: by deploying devastating financial threats against each one individually, to compel compliance and prevent coalitions. Trump could have started by imposing a tax on universities’ endowments, a move that almost certainly would enjoy broad popular support. That, however, would presumably affect every major university, which could prompt them to band together. Research grants, which are specific to each university, are an ideal instrument to divide and weaken them.
    - His first target, Columbia University, acceded to his demands within two weeks of losing $400 million in grants and contracts. When Columbia’s first sacrifice didn’t bring back the money, the university made another: its interim president, Katrina Armstrong. That didn’t satisfy Trump, who now [reportedly](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-consent-decree-trump-federal-funding-2f4c4690) wants Columbia to agree to direct government oversight. He is also brandishing financial threats, separately, at the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, Cornell, Brown, Johns Hopkins and Northwestern — and still there is no sign of organized resistance on the part of universities. There is not even a joint statement in defense of academic freedom or an assertion of universities’ value to society. (Even people who have no use for the humanities may see value in medical schools and hospitals.)
    - It shouldn’t be this easy to cleave universities from one another, but, so far, it seems to be easier even than making law firms compete for the don’s business and favor. This may be because law firms define success in a way that is at least marginally closer to their ideal function (helping to uphold the rule of law) than the way universities define success is to their ideal function, which is producing and disseminating knowledge. Most prominent American universities, most of the time, measure their success not so much by the degree to which their faculty and graduates contribute to the world as by the size of their endowment, the number of students seeking admission and their ascent in rankings by U.S. News & World Report and others, which assess the value of a university education in part by looking at graduates’ starting salaries. As for professors, while universities do compete for the best minds, they more frequently compete for the loudest names, in the hopes that these will attract the biggest bucks.
    - In [conversations](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/opinion/trump-higher-education.html) with my colleagues on these pages, I have compared the universities’ current predicament to the prisoners’ dilemma, the game-theory model in which two people accused of a crime have to decide to act for themselves or take a chance and act in concert. It’s a useful model to think about, but it doesn’t quite fit. The universities are not co-conspirators: they are competitors. And they want more than to return to the status quo ante: They want growth. They might even want to win the research funding that the other guy lost.
    - Trump has threatened to use many different tools against universities: pulling federal financial aid, revoking accreditation, rescinding nonprofit status, imposing an endowment tax and blocking the flow of international students. Nor — as the case of Columbia has already demonstrated — will submission end the attack. Slashing and burning its way through the National Institutes of Health, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Wilson Center, the United States Institute of Peace, the Smithsonian, and others, the administration has shown that it considers knowledge production worthless. In the rare areas where the president — or perhaps Elon Musk — may see value in research, the emergent mafia state is almost certain to distribute funds to its friends. One shudders to think what universities would have to do to fit themselves into that category.
    - **In the late 1970s and through the 1980s,** Polish dissidents operated what they called a “flying university” in apartments across the country. Run by the country’s leading intellectuals, this university wasn’t selective and didn’t charge tuition; its only goal was to get knowledge to as many people as possible. These were the people who went on to build the only post-Communist democracy that, so far, has been able to use electoral means to reverse an autocratic attempt. In the 1990s, Kosovo Albanians responded to the Serbian regime’s forced takeover of their education system by walking out and creating a parallel underground school system, from first grade through university. Classes met in boarded-up storefronts. I met Albin Kurti, the current prime minister of Kosovo, in 1998, when he was a student — and a student activist — in the underground university.
    - Adopting such a radical approach, and forsaking the usual concerns of development offices and communications departments, would be costly, to be sure. The universities most actively targeted by Trump have the resources necessary to weather such a radical reorientation. But as Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College, told me, “Too many of our wealthiest universities have made their endowments their primary object of protection.”
    - I called Botstein because he has long practiced the approach I am advocating: At Bard (where I taught for three years and continue to work with an archive of Russian media), he seems to respond to every crisis by figuring out ways to teach more people. In the last quarter-century, Bard’s expansion has focused on people who would ordinarily not have access to a university education. The university works in New York State prisons, where it currently has more than 400 enrolled students; in six cities it operates 10 high schools from which students graduate with a Bard associate degree; and it runs “microcolleges” at the Brooklyn Public Library, in Harlem and at a center for young mothers and low-income women in Holyoke, Mass.
    - The students at these places, who far outnumber students at the college’s main campus, don’t pay for their university education, are unlikely to boost Bard’s post-graduation income statistics, and probably won’t be able to make significant donations to the endowment in the future. But their lives are often transformed by Bard’s intervention. Many private universities have extension programs and several have prison programs and other community projects, but they tend to position them as charity sidelines rather than part of their core mission. Bard, on the other hand, is a private college that acts like the best kind of public university.
    - I asked Botstein how he balanced this kind of expansionism with his fiduciary responsibilities as president of the college. He said that he is a “naïve believer” in good ideas and so far the ideas have been good enough to attract philanthropists. He doesn’t think a university has to be rich, he told me — and Bard, with its $270 million endowment, decidedly is not. In his view, universities, “portals to tolerance and the expression of fundamental equality of all human beings,” are essential to democracy. A child of Holocaust survivors who came to this country as a stateless person in 1949, Botstein is particularly sensitive to the ways of an autocratic government. Three weeks into the Trump administration, he [called](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/opinion/american-universities-must-take-a-stand.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare&sgrp=g&pvid=7E6996C9-11B9-496E-B713-02C0C5401D19) on universities to band together in the face of an existential threat posed by the government. That was three weeks into the _first_ Trump administration.
    - So this is my radical proposal for universities: Act like universities, not like businesses. Spend your endowments. Accept more, not fewer students. Open up your campuses and expand your reach not by buying real estate but by bringing education to communities. Create a base. Become a movement.
    - Alternatively, you can try to negotiate with a mafia boss who wants to see you grovel. When these negotiations fail, as they inevitably will, it will be too late to ask for the public’s support.

Few Americans, if any, had ever heard of John Eastman before the events of [January 6, 2021](https://substack.com/redirect/9d005648-d3f9-4c32-930c-1623009cfe05?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg). The [legal architect](https://substack.com/redirect/3955e64f-66a5-4ee1-8709-dc14f1676425?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg) of Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election was hardly a high-profile name, even for those steeped in covering American politics. He was, in many ways, an unknown, pulled by the events and the aftermath of January 6 into the riptides of American history.

A handful of analysts and investigators tracing the contours of the American far right, however, knew of Eastman’s work long before the events of January 6, and of the kind of churning, burning illiberalism that brought him into Trump’s orbit. One of those was Katherine Stewart, whose new book, _[Money, Lies, and God](https://substack.com/redirect/6885815a-1322-4282-b140-2119cbec619a?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg),_ threads the diffuse movements that have congealed into the authoritarianism at the core of Trumpism.

Stewart first intersected with Eastman not in the aftermath of Trump’s failed insurrection but in 2019, when she tracked him to a tony, rarefied conclave in, of all places, Verona, Italy. Eastman was speaking at the annual conference of the World Congress of Families—a far-right, Russian-American organization dedicated to the abolition of abortion and the buttressing of so-called “traditional values”—regaling his audience with tales of “how secularism, liberalism, and gender confusion are destroying everything good in the world.” The speech, as Stewart writes, revealed Eastman to be “a committed ally of the theocrats.” But there was also “some foundation other than biblical literalism,” Stewart sensed, propelling him and cementing the kinds of illiberal alliances crucial to Trump’s reign.

The search for the broader foundations of Eastman’s and his allies’ beliefs is at the center of _Money, Lies, and God_, the follow-up to Stewart’s critically acclaimed 2020 _[The Power Worshippers](https://substack.com/redirect/8d2699f7-d035-4acf-800b-0c6e06f67abf?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg)._ That book explored the dogmatism at the core of the American religious right, and how such forces drew American evangelicals further and further into the illiberal abyss. It was, at the time, a signal flare of just how willingly such professedly godly groups could embrace a figure like Trump.

Stewart’s newest book is a continuation of that theme. But after the events of January 6, it was clear that the right had changed. This movement—with all the ideological allies, deep-pocketed donors, and misogynists massing around Eastman, joining him in this antidemocratic fight—presents a new face of the American far right. And it is that edifice that Stewart masterfully details in her new book, explaining not only why these pro-Trump forces have already attempted to drive a stake through the heart of American democracy, but how they will try to do so once again.

Part on-the-ground conversations, part sociological analysis, _Money, Lies, and God_ is a convincing tour of the mutually reinforcing elements of American reaction:

> “apostles” of Jesus, atheist billionaires, reactionary Catholic theologians, pseudo-Platonic intellectuals, woman-hating opponents of “the gynocracy,” high-powered evangelical networkers, Jewish devotees of Ayn Rand, pronatalists preoccupied with a dearth of (white) babies, COVID truthers, and battalions of “spirit warriors” who appear to be inventing a new style of religion even as they set about undermining democracy at its foundations.

Trumpism is hardly one thing, even if it is overly reliant on Trump himself. Instead, Stewart uses her deep familiarity with the American far right to chart out what are, by the mid-2020s, the major elements of Trump’s political project, which she describes as the Funders, Power Players, Infantry, Sergeants, and Thinkers. The “Funders” are those within the billionaire class bankrolling the forces below them, using access to effectively bottomless pots of wealth to guide American politics. Some of these names are increasingly familiar, like Leonard Leo, the benefactor who helped [steer the Supreme Court picks](https://substack.com/redirect/d135c14d-4e0a-45f9-9676-ab900cc488b8?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg) during Trump’s first term, building out Trumpist allies on the highest court of the land and helping rule in favor of things like all-encompassing [presidential immunity](https://substack.com/redirect/3a0cc1fc-c755-4a9b-a257-f26ce0faece3?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg), a position once ridiculed when [espoused](https://substack.com/redirect/c4e56121-9934-4f76-adcb-538895347bf5?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg) by figures like disgraced Richard Nixon. Leo serves as the chair of CRC Advisors, which, as Stewart writes, “directs over $1 billion in right-wing funding toward reactionary causes.” Nor is Leo alone. There is Carl Anderson, head of the Knights of Columbus, who helps bankroll think tanks and media outlets. There are even organizations like Opus Dei, a far-right Catholic group that does not publicize its membership rolls. All of them together have access to, and help direct, a greater pile of money than anything hard-right forces in America have ever known. “The decisive development in the first decades of the 21st century was not the alliance between Team Money and Team God but the simple fact that, thanks to escalating inequality, the big money got a lot bigger,” Stewart notes. “What was new was the number of zeroes in the checks—and the extremism of the thinking guiding the money people.”

Elsewhere, the “Power Players” Stewart identifies are those just underneath the “Funders,” helping direct some of the ocean of money flooding pro-Trump, pro-authoritarian movements. These managerial types comprise a “tiny elite” who “amass tremendous personal power by mobilizing others around their agendas.” Many of these are well-established figures, “super-lobbyists” like the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s Ralph Reed or Family Research Council’s Tony Perkins, who act as both organizers and mouthpieces for pro-Trump policies. These, Stewart says, are the “operational masterminds of the antidemocratic movement,” putting the funding into action through sponsoring conferences, conclaves, and publications. They are, in effect, middlemen—a kind of managerial class directing America’s antidemocratic turn.

The “Infantry,” meanwhile, is made up of the rank-and-file Trump voters who lap up the kinds of antidemocratic rhetoric spilling out of everything from conspiratorial social media feeds to, now, the White House itself. These are the militias, the Tea Party turned Trumpers, and the assorted flotsam of Trump supporters who launched an attempted insurrection on January 6—and who were all recently pardoned by Trump. They are those who Stewart writes about meeting in Las Vegas in 2023. Alongside a German documentary crew, Stewart joins a swell of Trump backers at the ReAwaken America Tour, a pro-Trump conference-cum-revival that gathers an audience of QAnon supporters, antivaxxers, racists, and conspiracy theorists. Stewart finds the crowd descending into increasing mania, with speakers not only regurgitating the most malign conspiracies they can find but even calling for “Nuremberg trials” for Trump’s enemies, leaving one of the German team members to ask Stewart, “Are we safe here?” For those tracing America’s descent into authoritarianism, some of these faces are well known; figures like Reed and Perkins have both been peddling illiberal policies for years, long predating the rise of Trump, and it’s hardly news that Trump’s base is comprised of conspiratorial racists. In that sense, Stewart’s book is treading familiar ground. But it sets itself apart in describing the two remaining groups—the “Sergeants” and the “Thinkers”—and how these two now buttress not just Trump but modern Christian nationalism itself.

The “Sergeants” are primarily pastors and related church officials, many of whom have accelerated their rightward lurch in recent years. These groups have ominous, vaguely militaristic names, including things like the Black Robe Regiment and the Watchmen on the Wall. These are the followers of the vengeful God of the Old Testament, believers in the efficacy of retribution. “There is little room for the old ‘Love the sinner, hate the sin’ trope here,” Stewart writes. Instead, they embody a Christian nationalism that “is not a policy program; it is perhaps best understood as a political mindset.” It is a political proclivity that “includes four basic dispositions: catastrophism; a persecution complex; identitarianism; and an authoritarian reflex.” All of it comprises the kind of kindling from which opposition to democracy, and even support for fascism, can emerge.

Many of these “spirit warriors” found their way to the so-called “Jericho March” in Washington on January 5, 2021. A “combination of nationalism, conspiracism, and demon obsession,” according to Stewart, the rally featured a range of pastors trying to outdo one another in their antediluvian rhetoric. One, Greg Bramlage, claimed they were engaged in a “spiritual battle,” while another, Bishop Leon Benjamin, called for followers to “kill” unspecified “demons.” Another pastor, the Reverend Kevin Jessip, described the rally as a “strategic gathering of men in this hour to dispel the Kingdom of Darkness.” Twenty-four hours later, as Stewart notes, many who prayed under these “Sergeants” took up arms and took the fight directly to the Capitol itself—bringing with them a “large wooden cross,” a separate “flag with a cross,” and banners blaring, “Jesus Saves.”

It is the final group, the “Thinkers,” that presents arguably Stewart’s most insightful sections. These are the figures like Eastman and his allies who posit themselves as the ideological, intellectual class crafting the contours of Trumpism—and identifying the kinds of legal cover Trump can use to dismantle American democracy. Much of this cohort can trace directly back to the Claremont Institute, the California-based organization where Eastman [remains a senior fellow](https://substack.com/redirect/1061c25e-21c9-47a7-8e91-21290dd5adaa?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg). As Stewart points out, it is the Claremont Institute where the “erstwhile reverence for America’s founders has been transfigured, with the help of political theorists purloined from Germany’s fascist period, into material support” for Trumpism.

The institute’s modus vivendi centers on the “Straussian man in action”—the man who bends history to his own ends, regardless of the consequence and regardless of democratic legitimacy. Stewart writes:

> His mission is to save the republic. He must tell a few lies, yet he is nonetheless a noble liar, at least in his own mind. He acts in the political world, where natural right reigns, and not merely in the legal world where lawyers are supposed to toil. Aware of the crooked timber from which humanity is made, he is prepared to break off whatever branches are needed for the bonfire of liberty.

This core Claremont belief leads to the yearning for a so-called “Red Caesar”—a masculine leader untrammeled by anything like democratic oversight or political pushback, grabbing a society by the throat and forcing it back into a world in which men, and especially white men, are once more restored to the top of America’s sociopolitical hierarchy. Indeed, there is an almost obsessive approach at Claremont to restoring supposed masculinity within American society. Stewart traces this belief system at Claremont—where, she says, all of the board members “appear to be male”—to Harvey C. Mansfield Jr., who wrote a 2006 book called _Manliness_ and “counts as nobility among Claremont’s extended family.” As Mansfield argued, “gender stereotypes are all true”—including, bizarrely, that women would make bad soldiers because “they fear spiders.”

As Stewart details, Mansfield was “far too sophisticated to openly argue for stripping American women of the rights they have fought for over the past two centuries—but in the private sphere, “those highly accurate stereotypes should reign triumphant.” This belief has seeped into Claremont’s bones and manifested itself at Claremont many times over. There is a Claremont Fellow named Jack Murphy who once said that “[feminists need rape](https://substack.com/redirect/abeb7039-fa55-450e-8e08-107bda827158?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg).” There was another Claremont official who gave a talk titled, “Does Feminism Undermine the Nation?” There is the promotion of work by an author named Coston Alamariu—better known by his nom de plume “Bronze Age Pervert”—who oozes undiluted misogyny and rails against “the gynocracy.” As Alamariu wrote, “It took 100 years of women in public life for them to almost totally destroy a civilization”—and the only way forward is to “use Trump as a model of success.”

These Claremont-based “Thinkers” also include figures like Curtis Yarvin, who has contributed to the Claremont publication _American Mind_ and “appeared as an honored guest on Claremont podcasts.” Yarvin’s affections for despotism have been widely reported elsewhere, but it is his historical ignorance that highlights just how shallow the Claremont men’s pretensions at intellectualism truly are. Not only does Yarvin [preposterously believe](https://substack.com/redirect/7970a39d-4409-4cb2-866d-36ac599657f4?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg) that “European civilization” wasn’t responsible for any genocides before the Holocaust—as if genocides in places like the [Africa](https://substack.com/redirect/1c9718e5-478e-4f6d-8103-1073ab4d8953?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg), [North America](https://substack.com/redirect/1bd6b695-67f1-4638-87fa-608b85ae0cfd?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg), or even [Ireland](https://substack.com/redirect/cec835f4-fb0a-4ace-824f-00ffbbdbeb30?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg) and [Ukraine](https://substack.com/redirect/eb0a8131-9be8-4654-a7b2-50f3d91826d6?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg) never existed—but he further maintains that America now needs to collapse into dictatorship in order to rebuild.

The “men of Claremont frame their not-so-hidden longing for revenge as a series of ruminations about the rise of an American Caesar,” Stewart writes. “And when that ‘Red Caesar’ arrives, he can thank the oligarchs for funding his rise, and he can thank the rank and file of the movement for supporting him in the name of ‘authenticity.’ But he would owe at least as large a debt of gratitude to the unhappy men of Claremont, those spurned would-be members of the intellectual elite … for explaining just who he is, and why he should go ahead and blow the whole place up.”

Taken together, _Money, Lies, and God_ paints not only a devastating picture of the state of American democracy (as if one was needed) but one that also contributes texture and context to understanding the current American political moment. The book convincingly argues that, when it comes to figures like Eastman or Leo or any of the men affiliated with the Claremont Institute, calls for dialogue and civility are futile. “In earlier times this may have been sage advice,” Stewart writes. “Today it is a delusion. American democracy is failing because it is under direct attack, and the attack is not coming equally from both sides. The movement described in this book isn’t looking for a seat at the noisy table of American democracy; it wants to burn down the house.” American democracy isn’t simply dying. It is, as Stewart observes, being murdered.

Another revelation from the book, however, is not nearly as ominous. Because the movement comprises so many moving parts, there’s no guarantee that such a constellation of forces can last. Trump remains the glue that holds such a coalition together, with each group—the billionaires and the bullies in the pulpits, the keyboard conspiracists and the misogynists trying to put an intellectual sheen on it all—each seeing, and often getting, what they want with him. But once Trump goes, there’s every reason to suspect that such a coalition will splinter, undone by competing claims. Wide cleavages remain on subjects from China to health care to tax cuts, bridged only through Trump’s person and persona.

This is cold comfort for those hoping for a resuscitation of American democracy anytime soon. Trump has spent the first months in his second term sprinting toward a constitutional crisis, cheered on by the allies he’s found along the way—not least the supposed “Thinkers” claiming intellectual leadership of the movement. For figures like Eastman, it’s not an executive run amok that presents a threat to the core of American democracy but, rather, those who would stand in Trump’s way. The Democratic Party, [Eastman said in 2023](https://substack.com/redirect/e9ef85df-ee21-49f8-9344-82c014842ad0?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg), is “an existential threat to the very survivability, not just of our nation, but of the example that our nation, properly understood, provides to the world. That’s the stakes.” From his lips to God’s—or at least Trump’s—ears.

  - Pundits and politicians say it incessantly: Our political system is broken because we are so “polarized.” They tell us that “polarization” prevents us from passing legislation or reaching a compromise or getting along.
  - This is bunk, not to mention a dangerous false equivalence, which minimizes the threat of authoritarianism.
  - If you didn’t know better you would think “polarization” descended from on high, a plague for which no one party is responsible. This deliberate obfuscation of our political situation suits the corporate media’s obsession with moral equivalence and contrived balance.

  - History provides clarity. We would not have said the Confederacy was “polarized.” The Confederacy, as professor [Stephanie McCurry](https://substack.com/redirect/ebb33576-bab6-4316-9483-505e693ca68b?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg) wrote in 2020, was a “big, centralized state, devoted to securing a society in which enslavement to white people was the permanent and inherited condition of all people of African descent.” Tyranny results not from polarization but from oppression.
  - Other countries’ experiences help distinguish polarization from authoritarianism. Hungary’s problem is not polarization; it’s the authoritarian rule of Viktor Orban who suppresses dissent, silences the media, and strips the judiciary of independence. Many Hungarians want the return of the rule of law, free speech, and robust civil society while Orban does not. But who would call that a “polarization” problem? It’s a dictator problem.
  - Whether it is Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s police state in Turkey or neo-fascist parties in Europe or MAGA’s takeover of the Republican Party, the defining feature that should concern us is not mutual intransigence or a widening ideological gap. Rather, in the United States and around the globe we see ordinary democratic parties (warts and all) up against authoritarian movements (some successful, others not) that reject democracy, truth, decency, pluralism, and the rule of law.
  - The central feature in the U.S.—a cult of personality in which the erratic, chaotic, and unhinged leader runs roughshod over its people—has nothing to do with Democrats. We cannot blame the small “d” democrats (or the large “D” ones either) for extremism or intransigence simply for insisting their fellow countrymen recognize objective reality and respect democratic norms.
  - When we look at individual issues, the rampant, inappropriate use of “polarization” stands out. It would, for example, be absurd to say we are “polarized” on the issue of immunization. _Gosh, if only each side were not so stuck in its position. Those Democrats are so fixated on medicine and science_. One side has, frankly, lost its mind on the subject; the other has not. Extreme authoritarians have overtaken one political party, putting at risk functional government and democracy itself, while another party remains a traditional center-left party.
  - Besides concealing the menace of authoritarianism, the indiscriminate use of the word “polarization” blurs the distinction between political elites and ordinary people. [TIME magazine](https://substack.com/redirect/13fb3749-dde4-4513-a387-976b645e1a04?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg) reported in 2024:
  - > Ordinary folks think Americans are much more partisan than they are. In the same study, people grossly overestimated (by 78%) the size of the most polarized group within each party—that is, Democrats who call themselves liberal and Republicans who call themselves conservative. At the same time, ordinary Americans grossly _under_estimated (by 77%) the share of the other party who are moderate. That share is, in fact, at least half of either party. “People probably are exactly right about how polarized their leaders are,” says Robb Willer, a sociologist at Stanford. “They get it very wrong for the general public.”
  - Other data suggest that right-wing extremism (the real source of anti-democratic fervor) has not overtaken the entire populace. [A 2022 More in Common](https://substack.com/redirect/e4354f92-f1d1-4c5a-860e-f9158d24cb9f?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg) survey on the so-called history wars (what should we teach about America), for example, showed that “for the vast majority of Americans, the differences in how we perceive and want our national story taught are far narrower than a few high-profile polemics might suggest.”
  - MAGA officeholders and media figures inveigh against nebulous CRT or DEI, but in practice, normal people do not follow the loudest voices enunciating the most extreme views (positions held by less than 15 percent of adults). In the real world, Americans overwhelmingly think, for example, that we should teach about the good and bad parts of American history and the legacy of slavery. Just as [MAGA cranks](https://substack.com/redirect/1674369f-80a1-4e06-a371-d320f662d561?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg) exaggerate the extent of trans women’s participation in sports, they would also have us believe that “liberals” don’t want to teach anything positive about America.

The Roman Way to Trash a Republic - The Atlantic

When you’re the emperor Augustus, they let you do it.

![A bust of the Roman emperor Augustus flanked with two branches](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/efzXftWRi6Whkrnd_SE_5JxmfbQ=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2025/04/25_4_15_Berenfield_roman_republic_final/original.jpg)

In about 80 years, roughly the same length of time between the end of World War II and now, the Roman Republic was transformed into a dictatorship. If you had told a Roman senator at the beginning of the first century B.C.E. that his grandchildren would willingly hand over governance to a monarch, he would not have believed you. Like the American one, the Roman Republic was founded on the rejection of a king. Rome had a representative government that, though flawed, was based on the rule of law, with freedom of speech and rights to legal recourse for its citizens.

The Roman Republic lasted nearly 500 years, about twice as long as Americans have had theirs. As was surely true for the Romans, most Americans can hardly imagine that their system of self-government might break and be replaced by an imperial dynasty. That is why considering what undid the Roman Republic is useful today—if we can learn from the Romans’ mistakes.

Augustus was Rome’s first emperor. In so becoming, he dismantled the republic and founded a monarchy that would last for more than a millennium. In Rome, most aristocratic men were also senators and usually held that position for life. In the later republic, some of those men—notably, Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus—grew so extraordinarily rich and influential that they began to ignore the constraints of the Senate and the law. In the first century B.C.E., decades of aristocratic overreach and the authoritarian violence of Augustus’s predecessors [Sulla](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sulla) and Caesar brought Rome to the brink more than once, but Augustus pushed it over the edge.

He took control of the government gradually but completely, with the support of those wealthy aristocrats who valued fortune above principle and with the complaisance of a population exhausted by conflict and disillusioned by a system that favored the rich and connected. Perhaps most salient for us today, Augustus consolidated his power with the institutional blessing of the Senate.

At first, the Senate let Augustus bend rules and push boundaries. It allowed him to accumulate domestic powers and bring unqualified members of his family into government. The Senate stood by while Augustus removed enemies from his path, and supported him when he put a self-serving spin on recent actions. Even when elections were held under Augustus, he often handpicked state officials.

The senators never called him emperor in his own day, but as _primus inter pares_, or first among equals, Augustus was allowed to pretend he was part of the republican system even as he destroyed it. Those who praised Augustus and those who failed to fight back, despite their misgivings, created a king by another name. They may have believed they were securing their own positions by doing so, but their acquiescence to Augustus meant the practical end of their power, forever. In their defense, Rome’s senators legitimately feared death if they broke with him; Augustus certainly had a lot of people killed. Our American senators apparently have only primaries to fear—yet they and their congressional colleagues have shown little inclination to rein in their leader or assert their own constitutional powers.

[Read: The man who sacked Rome](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/douglas-boin-alaric-the-goth/612268/)

An ambitious and ruthless political operator such as Augustus provides opponents with only so many chances to stop him. The Framers of our Constitution drew on ancient Greek and Roman history when they established our republic and sought to protect it from the inevitable threat of dictatorship. When they discussed ways to avoid despotism, the Romans served as a cautionary tale. The checks and balances in the U.S. Constitution look very much like those that were in place in Rome before Augustus. There were none after him.

All of this might raise a flag over the love for ancient Rome expressed by our contemporary elites. Mark Zuckerberg’s admiration of Augustus is famous. He recently gave up his “Caesar” haircut for young–Marcus Aurelius curls and wears big T-shirts printed with Latin slogans. Elon Musk has donated several million dollars to support the study and “[appreciation of Greek-Roman culture](https://conscientiae.org/).” Steve Bannon regularly cites Roman history, in a selective and idiosyncratic way, as a guide for modern politics. During Donald Trump’s first term, Bannon helped found a “gladiator school” at a former monastery near Rome, where students would be trained in a curriculum designed to save Western civilization.

Like the wealthy elites of ancient Rome who aligned themselves with a dictator so that they could increase their fortunes, the richest and most influential men in America seem willing to let our republic fall apart as long as they believe that its demise is in their interest. And they might prosper by it. Or not. That’s the thing about capricious one-man rule—no one, not even billionaires with spaceships, can be sure they won’t get on the bad side of the emperor and suffer as a result. Thanks to the Senate that enabled him, Augustus—and every Roman emperor who followed—was a brutal dictator.

Some might argue that the empire that rose from the ashes of the republic brought peace and stability to the world for centuries to come. But this ignores the costs. The Romans were nearly always at war; their celebrated expansion was achieved by military subjugation of foreign lands and harsh repression of those they conquered. Augustus alone ordered the extrajudicial killing of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of domestic enemies. The supposedly stable dynasty he founded gave Rome Caligula and Nero; the latter’s death was followed by a bloody civil war. More mayhem followed, and not until a century after Augustus did the Senate finally reassert itself—by appointing another emperor and initiating a new line of succession. Some emperors made sure the roads were safe and the water clean, but these more admired rulers—Trajan, Hadrian, Marcus Aurelius—were nonetheless dictators. Even for the most privileged Romans, the empire could be a terrifying and unpredictable place in which a single man held absolute, arbitrary power.

The United States, too, may endure as a great power for centuries to come. The ultimate lesson of the Roman Republic’s fate is that once you’ve allowed one man to rule as a monarch, even if you pretend he doesn’t, you are past the point of no return. When Augustus died in his bed at a ripe old age, the Roman Senate made him a god. This seems an honor that even the most sycophantic U.S. senators would be unlikely to suggest for our president. But as they cede ever more of their power to him, our own era of Roman-style imperial rule may be drawing closer than we think.

Zuckerberg defends his empire during FTC antitrust trial | The Verge

Making Instagram a separate company. Buying Snapchat. Wiping everyone’s Facebook friends. Creating a feed of only ads.

These were some of the ideas that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg considered over the years as he built his social media empire. Over the past two days, he talked about them from the witness stand at a federal courthouse in Washington, DC, where Meta is fighting the Federal Trade Commission on an antitrust case that could ultimately require it to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp.

Zuckerberg has so far testified for roughly nine hours. He’s expected to continue testifying on Wednesday, followed by Sheryl Sandberg. So far, the FTC has prodded him to confirm its theory of the market and understand his motivation for acquiring nascent rivals.

The FTC’s theory of the case is that Meta gobbled up newer competitors by buying Instagram and WhatsApp in the early 2010s, when it feared they would grow to challenge its dominance. The agency is trying to show that Meta has monopoly power in a market it calls personal social networking services, which is focused on connecting with friends and family and includes the apps Snapchat and MeWe.

Meta argues that the FTC has crafted a purpose-built definition of a market just to go after the company. During his testimony on Tuesday, Zuckerberg politely resisted questions from the FTC that sought to establish its view of the market. He testified that he sees the market as “fluid” but that TikTok, YouTube, and iMessage are his top competitors right now.

On several occasions, the FTC pointed to marketing language Meta used to tout its role in connecting friends and family and tried to draw distinctions between Facebook and services like LinkedIn. Zuckerberg rarely offered one-word answers and would tease out the nuances of how he thinks that Meta’s products overlap with many other services. Sure, Facebook advertises itself as a place to connect with friends on its sign-up page, but that’s probably just the tagline that tested most favorably, he testified. And while LinkedIn markets itself as a career-oriented service, Zuckerberg noted that some of its features overlap with Meta’s.

Other documents presented at trial gave a backstory to the big decisions Meta made over the years, along with a view of what some alternate realities might have looked like. Maybe Meta could have owned Snapchat as well, had CEO Evan Spiegel accepted Zuckerberg’s $6 billion bid in late 2013. If Spiegel had said yes, Meta would have grown Snapchat much faster, he speculated from the stand.

Zuckerberg suggested the idea of wiping users’ friends lists to experience the joy of starting from scratch

When he was wondering about how to bring some early magic back to Facebook in 2022, Zuckerberg suggested the idea of [wiping users’ friends lists](https://www.theverge.com/news/649246/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-friends-wipe-reset-meta-antitrust-trial) to experience the joy of starting from scratch. He even considered [beating the government to the punch](https://www.theverge.com/policy/649213/mark-zuckerberg-meta-instagram-spin-off-ftc-antitrust-trial) by spinning off Instagram — the very app he’s [now fighting so hard to keep](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/mark-zuckerberg-meta-antitrust-ftc-negotiations-a53b3382?mod=hp_lead_pos3).

Another FTC theory is that Meta has been able to increase its ad load over time because its users don’t have alternative services. Zuckerberg suggested that Meta at one point considered making a feed of only ads because its users think they’re as good as regular content.

Then, there are the messages that Zuckerberg exchanged with his top executives about decisions the company actually made.

The FTC presented internal documents that showed Zuckerberg had been scared that his company was falling behind Instagram’s rapid growth, and that he worried messaging apps like WhatsApp could eventually be used to encroach on the social media sphere. In court, he argued that his acquisitions of those apps made them into what they are today.

### E ink readers review good

    Goodbye Kindle, I don't think I'll miss you. - Duarte O.Carmo

![boox palma on table](https://duarteocarmo.com/images/78/boox_3.webp)

Even though it never _really_ replaced physical books for me, I've been a [big Kindle user](https://kindle-highlights.email/) for many years. The ability to take hundreds of books with me anywhere is priceless. Vitto even has a running joke that I tend to lose them on the plane.

I love my Kindle so much I _never_ thought I'd replace it.

But I did. And it feels GREAT.

I first heard of the [Boox Palma](https://shop.boox.com/products/palma) from [Riccardo](https://riccardo.im/), and then repeatedly from [David](https://www.theverge.com/24184777/boox-palma-e-ink-smartphone-reader). When nerds recommend a new gadget, I'm usually skeptical, but hey, these are _respectable_ nerds after all. After 2/3 weeks of hesitation, asking Vitto repeatedly if I should go for it (as usual) - I decided to finally press the button.

From the moment it arrived, I never touched my Kindle ever again.

There are many good things about the Boox Palma. But I'll start with what hit me first: It's well built. One of my favourite things about the Kindle was that those things would last a long time (if you didn't leave them on the plane). I'm not sure the Boox Palma will last that long - but for the past 4 months of use, I can throw it pretty much everywhere - it's sturdy.

A Kindle that fits in your pocket. Now how great does that sound? One of my all-time annoyances with the Kindle was the fact that it was great to carry - but ONLY as long as you have a backpack. For airplane travel, it's great. But for every other time I left home without a bag - I just didn't take it. Now, with something that fits in my pocket, every occasion is a good occasion to take my e-reader with me. So I've found myself reading in places I would never have before. Waiting for a friend? Going out for lunch somewhere? Which is one of the big reasons why I love this gadget: it makes me read more!

We can't talk about an e-reader without talking about the display. I'm by no means a display expert, but it's pretty sharp. You can tweak the refresh modes and filters - but I don't really tend to do so. I do tend to adjust the color temperature. Quite a lot, actually. If I'm reading at night I want something yellower. If I'm reading during the day I want something colder. My only complaint about the display is the lack of a native dark mode. I wish I could touch a button and _all_ the colors in my device would just invert. But either that option isn't available, or I haven't found it.

No more Amazon. No more kindle store, no more 'send-to-kindle', no more 'we could not send your file', no more 'when does this thing sync so I can see my book'. Bye Amazon. With the Boox, all I need is Dropbox. The Boox Palma is something the Kindle never was: A full-fledged Android phone. I can install whatever I want, whenever I want. My RSS reader? Check. My newspaper apps? Check. The actual Kindle app? Also!



And it lasts a long time! I tend to read ~1 hour every night, and more during traveling, and it comfortably lasts 2+ weeks without charging. Worth noting that I don't watch YouTube videos on it. You could. But not sure what the point would be.

The Boox Palma is not perfect. The company has tried to shove AI down the users' throats a couple of times. I think I've received a single software update in ~4 months, which is not the most encouraging. And yes - it's an Android phone, but for everything else other than reading - it will feel sluggish. Expected? Probably. But it also costs 2-3 times what a Kindle does.

But the reason why I loved my Kindle was not because it was powerful, or because of its great software. It was because it just made me read more often.

And that's also why I love the Boox Palma. Because it _makes_ me read more.

  - April 9, 2025, 5:24 PM ET
  - _Updated at 8:44 p.m. ET on April 9, 2025_
  - Over the course of one afternoon and evening last month, the Department of Homeland Security [loaded three planes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/03/16/deportation-flights-trump-el-salvador/) with migrants, most of them Venezuelan men whom the Trump administration had determined, on the basis of little to no evidence, to be members of the gang Tren de Aragua. The planes departed Texas and flew across the Gulf of Mexico toward Central America, even as a judge in Washington, D.C., was holding a hearing on whether the U.S. government had the legal authority to remove those men from American soil. When the detainees landed in El Salvador, they were [greeted](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/americas/deportation-videos-el-salvador.html) by a phalanx of armed guards and led to the country’s notorious prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center, where their heads were shaved and their hands and feet shackled. By this time, the judge had already issued a ruling barring their transfer from the United States—but it was, as Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele smirked on X, “too late.”
  - This sequence of events is what led to the Supreme Court’s emergency [ruling late Monday night](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a931_2c83.pdf) in _J.G.G. v. Trump_, which held that the Trump administration cannot use the Alien Enemies Act to unilaterally remove supposed Venezuelan Tren de Aragua members from the U.S. without any legal process, yet also narrowed the path by which those detainees can contest their removal. If you read the majority’s opinion alone, though, you would have no idea that roughly 260 people were currently incarcerated in a Salvadoran prison, many of them having been shipped there in apparent defiance of a court order. The decision—an unsigned opinion from the Court’s conservative bloc, minus Amy Coney Barrett—is strangely antiseptic. Yes, it marks a major loss for Donald Trump in its refusal to allow him to snatch people away in the middle of the night. But it also exhibits a disturbing willingness to ignore the brute facts of Trump’s actions and their human cost in favor of remaining within the more comfortable world of high-minded detachment.
  - Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act against Tren de Aragua was dubious from the start. The statute, which dates from 1798, provides the president with the authority to detain and remove “all natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects” of a “hostile nation or government” that has declared war on the United States or is engaged in an “invasion or predatory incursion.” Tren de Aragua is not—despite the White House’s claims—a government, there is no invasion of the United States, and the administration has provided scant evidence that any of the men identified as Tren de Aragua members have any affiliation with the gang. In fact, reporting suggests that the overwhelming majority of the people now incarcerated in El Salvador have [no criminal record whatsoever](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-09/about-90-of-migrants-sent-to-salvador-lacked-us-criminal-record?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=twitter?sref=NIGftWCk&embedded-checkout=true). Still, the administration claimed the authority under the Alien Enemies Act to remove these people from the country and render them to a foreign prison, with no court review.
  - [Adam Serwer: Trump’s Salvadoran gulag](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/trump-deportations-el-salvador/682267/)
  - This argument is appalling. And the Supreme Court rejected it, holding that “detainees subject to removal orders under the AEA are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal.” This is a significant loss for the Trump administration, and one that even the most right-wing justices signed on to.
  - The catch is _how_ that challenge to removal must be brought. The five-justice majority ruled that detainees must seek review of their case by filing for a writ of habeas corpus, the constitutional right that ensures a person’s ability to seek review of their imprisonment in court. For this reason, the Court vacated the temporary restraining orders that a district court had issued blocking the removal of any Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act, because the plaintiffs in _J.G.G._, represented by the ACLU, had sued under a different legal mechanism. Still, detainees currently in the United States will be able to seek judicial review before their removal. It’s through this process that a substantive challenge to the legality of the administration’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act will ultimately be brought.
  - There are several problems with this. Habeas is a more restrictive route through which to litigate these cases: Although the ACLU had originally been able to bring suit on behalf of everyone who might have been removed, habeas likely requires detainees to sue individually or, at most, district by district. (Today, [two separate judges](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/09/trump-administration-deportations-00007494) in New York and Texas responded to new habeas petitions by issuing orders blocking the government from removing anyone in specific regions or facilities, but these orders are limited to Venezuelans in those particular places, rather than providing nationwide protections.) It will also place these cases in front of potentially hostile judges in the more conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where many detainees are housed. And it remains deeply unclear just how much of an “opportunity to challenge” their removal these people will get.
  - Possibly the most disturbing aspect of this ruling, though, is that it remains entirely uncertain what the people stuck in Salvadoran prison are supposed to do now. This may become clearer once the Court rules in a separate case, _Abrego Garcia v. Noem_, concerning a man who was shipped to the Salvadoran prison [by mistake](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/an-administrative-error-sends-a-man-to-a-salvadoran-prison/682254/) and whom the administration is declaring it has no ability or obligation to get back. For now, though, the majority ruling does not even mention these prisoners or bother to note that the Trump administration seemingly ignored a court order in its rush to incarcerate them—an action that, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in dissent, “poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law.” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, writing separately, accused the majority of not being “willing to face” the consequences of its ruling.
  - [Adam Serwer: A ‘path of perfect lawlessness’](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/deportations-trump-supreme-court/682329/)
  - Strikingly, Jackson compared the Court’s decision in _J.G.G._ to _Korematsu_, in which the Court upheld the World War II internment of Japanese Americans. _Korematsu_ is one of the most infamous Supreme Court rulings in the history of the country, and judges do not cite it lightly—but by my count, this is [at least the third time in recent years](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/how-the-%27muslim-ban%27-case-foreshadowed-trump-v.-united-states) that a liberal justice has done so in dissent. In the travel-ban case, Sotomayor pointed to _Korematsu_ to decry the majority’s willingness to turn “a blind eye to the pain and suffering” caused by the ban. She cited it again in her dissent to the Court’s ruling establishing broad presidential immunity from criminal prosecution, warning of the risk of enabling a president to rampage without any expectation of accountability.
  - In both those cases, the conservative majority operated similarly to how it behaved in _J.G.G._—airily ignoring the danger posed by Trump’s actions to the republic and the people he has harmed. Instead, it prefers to inhabit a land of technicalities and abstractions. Ruling in the immunity case, Chief Justice John Roberts [seemed to serenely arrogate to the Court](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/07/trump-get-out-of-jail-free/678861/) an immense power to determine whether the president might ever face criminal consequence without worrying whether the emboldening of a rampaging executive might at some point place the authority of the judiciary in danger.
  - Some commentators, reviewing the Court’s approach to _J.G.G._ and other recent cases_,_ have wondered whether the majority [chose this technical approach](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/supreme-court-trump-confrontation.html?smtyp=cur&smid=bsky-nytimes) as a way of dodging direct confrontation with an out-of-control president who might choose to outright defy its orders. But this is not a White House in the habit of backing down. Sooner or later, regardless of whether the Court wants to acknowledge it, the bill is going to come due.

  - ---
  - Many American universities, [widely seen globally as beacons of academic integrity](https://www.higheredtoday.org/2024/06/11/higher-ed-greatest-defense/) and free speech, [are giving in to demands](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/universities-trump-lobbyists-funding-washington-a2e5c77a?mod=hp_lead_pos11) from the Trump administration, which [has been targeting](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/opinion/trump-higher-education.html) academia since it took office.
  - In one of his first acts, President Donald Trump [branded diversity, equity and inclusion programs as discriminatory](http://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-takes-action-eliminate-dei). His administration also launched [federal investigations](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/14/g-s1-53831/dei-universities-education-department-investigation) into [more than 50 universities](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/office-civil-rights-initiates-title-vi-investigations-institutions-of-higher-education-0), from smaller regional schools such as Grand Valley State University in Michigan and the New England College of Optometry in Massachusetts to elite private universities such as Harvard and Yale.
  - Trump ramped up the pressure by [threatening university research funding](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00849-y) and targeting specific schools. In one example, the Trump administration revoked US$400 million in grants to Columbia University over its alleged failures to curb antisemitic harassment on campus. The [school later agreed to most of Trump’s demands](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/nyregion/columbia-response-trump-demands.html), from tightening student protest policies to placing an entire academic department under administrative oversight – though the funding remains frozen.

[Harvard was sent a list of demands](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/trump-harvard-funding-demands.html?smid=url-share) in order to keep $9 billion in federal funding.
  - Now, across the United States, many universities are trying to [avoid being Trump’s next target](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/colleges-trump-dei-funding-changes-4b60c0bb). Administrators are [dismantling DEI initiatives](https://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-higher-eds-dismantling-of-dei?sra=true) – closing and rebranding offices, eliminating positions, revising training programs and sanitizing diversity statements – while professors are preemptively [self-censoring](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/diversity-equity/2025/02/06/trump-attacks-dei-faculty-pick-between-silence).
  - Not all institutions are complying. Some schools, such as [Wesleyan](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/opinion/trump-jewish-antisemitism-wesleyan.html?partner=slack&smid=sl-share), [have refused to abandon](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/trump-dei-executive-orders-schools.html) their diversity principles. And organizations including the [American Association of University Professors](https://www.aaup.org/report/against-anticipatory-obedience) [have filed lawsuits](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/02/18/trump-administration-faces-growing-number-lawsuits) challenging Trump’s executive orders, arguing they violate academic freedom and the First Amendment.
  - But these remain exceptions, as the [broader trend leans](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/race-ethnicity/2025/03/17/colleges-flag-words-women-comply-dei-bans#) toward institutional caution and retreat.
  - As a scholar of comparative and international education, I [study how academic institutions respond](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-TOk9DEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) to authoritarian pressure – across political systems, cultural contexts and historical moments. While some universities may believe that [compliance with the administration](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/universities-trump-lobbyists-funding-washington-a2e5c77a?mod=hp_lead_pos11) will protect their funding and independence, a [few historical parallels suggest otherwise](https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/how-democracies-die).

  -  German universities: A lesson
  - In the 1975 book “[The Abuse of Learning: The Failure of German Universities](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Abuse_of_Learning.html?id=SzgQAQAAMAAJ),” historian Frederic Lilge chronicles how German universities, which entered the 20th century in a [golden age](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198206606.003.0010) of global intellectual influence, did not resist the Nazi regime but instead adapted to it.
  - Even before seizing national power in 1933, the Nazi Party was closely monitoring German universities through [nationalist student groups](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/university-student-groups-in-nazi-germany) and [sympathetic faculty](https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/controlling-universities), flagging professors deemed politically unreliable – particularly Jews, Marxists, liberals and pacifists.
  - After Hitler took office in 1933, his regime moved [swiftly to purge](https://heritage.umich.edu/stories/in-the-face-of-fascists) academic institutions of Jews and political opponents. The 1933 [Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/timeline-event/holocaust/1933-1938/law-for-the-restoration-of-the-professional-civil-service) mandated the firing of Jewish and other “non-Aryan” professors and members of the faculty deemed politically suspect.
  - Soon after, professors were required to swear loyalty to Hitler, curricula were overhauled to emphasize “national defense” and “[racial science](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674018426)” – a pseudoscientific framework used to justify antisemitism and Aryan supremacy – and entire departments were restructured to serve Nazi ideology.
  - Some institutions, such as the Technische Hochschule Stuttgart, [even rushed to honor Hitler](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Abuse_of_Learning.html?id=SzgQAQAAMAAJ) with an honorary doctorate within weeks of his rise to power. He declined the offer, though the gesture signaled the university’s eagerness to align with the regime. Professional associations, such as the Association of German Universities, stayed silent, ignoring key opportunities to resist before universities lost their autonomy and became subservient to the Nazi state.
  - As linguist Max Weinreich wrote in his 1999 book “[Hitler’s Professors](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300053876/hitlers-professors/),” many academics didn’t just comply, they enabled the regime by reshaping their research. This legitimized state doctrine, helping build the intellectual framework of the regime.
  - A [few academics resisted and were dismissed](https://perspectives.ushmm.org/collection/higher-education-in-nazi-germany), exiled or executed. Most did not.
  - [The transformation of German academia](https://perspectives.ushmm.org/collection/higher-education-in-nazi-germany?utm_source=chatgpt.com) was not a slow drift but a swift and systemic overhaul. But what made Hitler’s orders stick was the eagerness of many academic leaders to comply, justify and normalize the new order. Each decision – each erased name, each revised syllabus, each closed program and department – was framed as necessary, even patriotic. Within a few years, German universities no longer served knowledge – they served power.
  - It would take more than a decade after the war, through [denazification, reinvestment and international reintegration](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674009332), for West German universities to begin regaining their intellectual standing and academic credibility.
  - ![a group of students stand in a room with two big columns and a mural of soviet propaganda on the wall](https://images.theconversation.com/files/658809/original/file-20250331-56-bu1b0h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip)
  - Under Stalin, dissenting scholars were purged and history rewritten to glorify the Communist Party. Moscow State University opened in 1953 with murals such as this one depicting Soviet symbols. [AP Photo/Zander Hollander](https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/MoscowUniversity1953/2c18fb83c1134f788ef5e9b27514f597/photo?Query=ussr%20university&mediaType=photo&sortBy=creationdatetime:desc&dateRange=Anytime&totalCount=47&currentItemNo=42)
  -  USSR and fascist Italy suffer similar fate
  - Other countries that have fallen under authoritarian regimes followed similar trajectories.
  - In fascist Italy, the shift began not with violence but with a signature. In 1931, the Mussolini regime required all university professors to swear [an oath of loyalty to the state](https://www.chronicle.com/article/what-autocrats-want-from-academics-servility). Out of more than 1,200, only 12 refused.
  - Many justified their compliance by insisting the oath had no bearing on their teaching or research. But by publicly affirming loyalty and offering no organized resistance, the academic community signaled its willingness to accommodate the regime. This lack of opposition allowed the fascist government to tighten control over universities and use them to advance its ideological agenda.
  - In the Soviet Union, this control was not limited to symbolic gestures – it reshaped the entire academic system.
  - After the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Bolsheviks oscillated between wanting to abolish universities as “feudal relics” and repurposing them to serve a socialist state, as historians [John Connelly](https://history.berkeley.edu/john-connelly) and [Michael Grüttner](https://www.dzhw.eu/en/gmbh/mitarbeiter?m_id=662) explain in their book “[Universities Under Dictatorship](https://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-02695-4.html?srsltid=AfmBOopHledCIIirKtG2Gs75E7RgNu1XC-uhyb5YLJP8OWEdxTBmUbUO).” Ultimately, they chose the latter, remaking universities as instruments of ideological education and technical training, tightly aligned with Marxist-Leninist goals.
  - Under Josef Stalin, [academic survival depended less](https://press.princeton.edu/books/ebook/9781400822140/stalinist-science-pdf) on scholarly merit than on conformity to official doctrine. Dissenting scholars were purged or exiled, history was rewritten to glorify the Communist Party, and entire disciplines such as genetics [were reshaped](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/12/trofim-lysenko-soviet-union-russia/548786/) to fit political orthodoxy.
  - [This model was exported](https://uncpress.org/book/9780807848654/captive-university/) across Eastern and Central Europe during the Cold War. In East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland, ministries dictated curricula, Marxism-Leninism became mandatory across disciplines, and admissions were reengineered to favor students from loyalist backgrounds. In some contexts, adherents to older intellectual traditions pushed back, especially in Poland, where resistance slowed though could not prevent the imposition of ideological control.
  - By the early 1950s, universities across the region had become what Connelly calls “[captive institutions](https://uncpress.org/book/9780807848654/captive-university/),” stripped of independence and recast to serve the state.
  - A more recent example is Turkey, where, following the [failed 2016 coup](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/turkey-how-the-coup-failed/), more than [6,000 academics were dismissed](https://www.chronicle.com/article/turkeys-university-leaders-are-expected-to-face-loyalty-inquiries/), [universities were shuttered](https://theconversation.com/why-turkey-wants-to-silence-its-academics-62885) and research deemed “subversive” was banned.
  -  History’s warning
  - The Trump administration’s early and direct intervention into higher education governance echoes historical attempts to bring universities under state influence or control.
  - The administration says it is doing so [to eradicate “discriminatory” DEI policies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/) and [fight what it sees as antisemitism on college campuses](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/). But by [withholding federal funding](https://apnews.com/article/columbia-university-funding-trump-fa70143c715df8fd4ef337c0e1ccf872), the administration is also trying to force universities into ideological conformity – by dictating whose knowledge counts but also whose presence and perspectives are permissible on campus.
  - [Columbia’s reaction to Trump’s demands](https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/2025-03-24-columbias-capitulation-wesleyans-pushback/) sent a clear message: Resistance is risky, but compliance may be rewarded – though the [$400 million has yet to be restored](https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2025/03/23/columbia-on-right-track-toward-final-negotiations-to-restore-canceled-federal-funds-mcmahon-says/). The speed and scope of its concessions set a precedent, signaling to other universities that avoiding political fallout now may mean rewriting policies, reshaping departments and retreating from controversy, perhaps before anyone even asks.
  - The Trump administration has already moved on to other universities, including the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/20/nx-s1-5333675/university-pennsylvania-upenn-trump-suspends-funding-trans-student-athletes) over its transgender policies, [Princeton for its climate programs](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/princeton-university-funding-cuts-climate-programs) and [Harvard over alleged antisemitism](https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2025/03/31/trump-administration-reviewing-9-billion-in-government-funding-for-harvard/). The question is which school is next.
  - The Department of Education has [launched investigations into over 50 institutions](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/14/g-s1-53831/dei-universities-education-department-investigation), accusing them of using “racial preferences and stereotypes in education programs and activities.” How these institutions choose to respond may determine whether higher education remains a space for open inquiry.
  - The pressure to conform is not just financial – it is also cultural. Faculty at some institutions [are being advised](https://www.chronicle.com/article/what-autocrats-want-from-academics-servility?sra=true) not to use “DEI” in emails and public communication, with warnings to not be a target. Academics [are removing pronouns](https://azmirror.com/briefs/erased-how-trumps-executive-orders-are-dismantling-diversity-at-maricopa-county-community-colleges/) from their email signatures and asking their students to comply, too. I’ve been on the receiving end of those warnings, and so have my counterparts at other institutions. And students on visas are [being warned](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/brown-university-travel-professor-green-card-deportation-aa6bff14) [not to travel outside the U.S.](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/politics/international-students-not-to-travel-outside-us/3826245/) after several [were deported](https://apnews.com/article/trump-foreign-students-campus-gaza-protests-deportation-9e2d4abc1c158454da1f68c01062c9ef) or denied reentry due to alleged involvement in protests.
  - Meanwhile, people inside and outside academia [are combing websites, syllabi](https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-diversity-detective?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=campaign_12943645_nl_Academe-Today_date_20250319&sra=true), [presentations](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/a-teacher-prep-conference-warned-against-mentioning-dei-presenters-pulled-out/2025/03) and public writing in search of what they consider ideological infractions. This type of [peer surveillance](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2025/04/01/department-leaders-told-to-report-all-dei-initiatives/) can reward silence, incentivize erasure and turn institutions against their own.
  - When universities start regulating not just what they say but what they teach, support and stand for – driven by fear rather than principle – they are no longer just reacting to political threats, they are internalizing them. And as history has shown, that may mark the beginning of the end of their academic independence.

  - Professors Timothy Snyder, Marci Shore, and Jason Stanley are leaving Yale for the University of Toronto. Some of their reasons might be personal and professional, but these well-known academics—two historians and a philosopher—aren’t just changing jobs. They’re fleeing America as they see it falling under an authoritarian regime. They’re watching the rule of law wither and due process disappear while a chill of fear settles over the country’s most powerful law firms, universities, and media owners. They’re getting out while they can.
  - So are thousands of other Americans who are looking for work abroad, researching foreign schools for their kids, trying to convert a grandparent’s birth country into a second passport, or saving up several hundred thousand dollars to buy citizenship in Dominica or Vanuatu. Many more Americans are discussing leaving with their families and friends. Perhaps you’re one of them.
  - When I heard the news of the Yale exodus, I wondered if my failure to explore an exit makes me stupid and complacent. I don’t want to think I’m one of the sanguine fools who can’t see the laser pointed at his own head—who doesn’t want to lose his savings and waits to flee until it’s too late. Perhaps I was supposed to applaud the professors’ wisdom and courage in realizing that the time had come to leave. But instead, I felt betrayed.
  - Snyder is a brilliant historian of modern Europe; Shore, his wife, is an intellectual historian focused on Eastern Europe; Stanley is an analytic philosopher who has refashioned himself as an expert on fascism. In the Trump era, Snyder and Stanley have published popular books on authoritarianism—_How Fascism Works, On Tyranny_, _The Road to Unfreedom_. All three professors have traveled to wartime Ukraine, tirelessly supported its cause, denounced Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, and explained to their fellow Americans what history teaches about the collapse of free countries into dictatorships. Snyder says that his reasons for leaving are entirely personal, but Shore [insists](https://kyivindependent.com/i-could-feel-the-reign-of-terror-spiraling-us-historian-marci-shore-on-leaving-trumps-america/) that she and her husband are escaping a “reign of terror” in America. Stanley compares the move to leaving Germany in 1933.
  - Snyder’s best-selling pamphlet, _On Tyranny_, is an instruction manual on how to resist authoritarianism. Lesson 1 warns: “Do not obey in advance.” It’s hard not to conclude that the Yale professors are doing just that. Cutting and running at a difficult moment, before the state has even targeted them, feels like a preemptive concession to Trump—a decision that Shore [says](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/28/us/yale-university-scholars-toronto-trump/index.html) she and Snyder made after his reelection.
  - Very few people are capable of heroism under oppression. For anyone facing death, arrest, or even persistent harassment, fleeing the country is the sane course. But the secret police aren’t coming for Snyder, Shore, or Stanley. Yale, like other top-ranking universities, stands to lose millions of dollars in federal funding, but its scholars—especially those with tenure and American citizenship—are still free to speak up on behalf of an unjustly deported immigrant, defend a trans student against bullying and humiliation, protest the destruction of the federal government, and even denounce Elon Musk on X. They can still write books about fascism—more urgently now than ever. Snyder, Shore, and Stanley are deserting their posts in this country just as the battle that they’ve warned us about and told us how to fight is coming to a head.
  - [Marc Novicoff: The Kennedy Center performers who didn’t cancel](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/kennedy-center-trump-cancellations/682106/)
  - Following Trump’s first election, in 2016, a British journalist published an essay in _The New Yorker_ explaining why, after decades in New York, she was returning to London. Having shown its best face during the Obama years, America had let her and itself down, so it was time to leave. She had obtained United States citizenship, but she was exercising her option to get out now that the going here was no longer good; if the winds shifted again, she might come back with her American passport. Abandoning a country that had treated her well at just the moment when it ran into trouble defined citizenship as a transactional relationship. The essay seemed written to confirm the right-wing stereotype of the coastal elite with no real commitment to this country.
  - You don’t have to be a dual citizen for your attachment to be transactional. Many Americans—I’m one—believe that our country’s identity rests on an idea, but an idea can be corrupted and betrayed, and then disillusionment might break the bonds of affection: _I’ll stay with you as long as you’re beautiful, good, and true. Let yourself go, and I’m out of here._ In an essay on the website Persuasion, a former government official, writing under the pseudonym William A. Finnegan, [says](https://www.persuasion.community/p/eulogy-for-a-republic) that he is going to expatriate himself because America has broken its promise and his heart. His essay is a farewell love letter from an American who served his country for years: “And so we grieve—not just for what we’re leaving behind, but for the version of America we once believed in.” This pseudonymous public servant isn’t leaving because of any personal danger. His America was worth staying for only as long as it remained the America of the Declaration and the Constitution, Lincoln’s last best hope, Reagan’s shining city on a hill. Trump’s gargoyle nation is unrecognizable to William A. Finnegan, and it’s too late to do anything about it: “If you still believe change is possible from within, I envy you. I truly do.”
  - How will you know when it’s time to go? When Trump deports an inconvenient American citizen and ignores a court order to bring him or her back home? Or when Yale is intimidated into firing a law professor for teaching civil rights? Or the Justice Department invents a pretext for FBI agents to confiscate computers in the offices of an independent publication and take down its website? Or the 2026 midterms seem certain to be unfree and unfair? Or when none of these extreme possibilities happens, but life in America becomes so rotten with injustice and corruption, so colorlessly orthodox, so unavoidably compromising, so impoverished, so shitty, that you lose the will to stay here? When your children plead with you to move abroad?
  - [Atossa Araxia Abrahamian: Americans are buying an escape plan](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/gold-card-residence-abroad/682103/)
  - What if you decide the time has come to leave and find that it’s too late?
  - I can’t answer these questions for myself, let alone for anyone else. But I don’t believe the time has come—not even close. Americans are just beginning to find their voices against the destruction of our democracy. They’re raising them in town halls, city streets, schools, media, courts, Congress, and conversations across the country. The awakening is slow and incoherent because the assault is coming so fast and on so many fronts: constitutional, legal, bureaucratic, economic, cultural, moral. Above all, moral. Trump’s greatest weapon is his power to convince Americans that their country isn’t worth saving. Some public intellectuals already seem persuaded.
  - The belief that America stands for an idea beyond blood and soil makes its identity fragile, because an idea lives in people’s minds, where it is subject to lies, hatred, ignorance, despair, even extinction. But for this very reason, as long as enough Americans continue to believe in the idea with enough conviction to stick it out here and fight, the country that you and I once lived in will still exist for the generation after us. Even with Trump memes, tariff charts, Signal chats, and masked police, America will remain my desecrated home. Snyder’s Lesson 19 is this command: “Be a patriot.”

5 of the most misunderstood quotes in philosophy - Big Think

Sign up for the Mini Philosophy newsletter

A place to pause and reflect on life’s bigger questions, with Big Think’s Jonny Thomson.

This article was first published on Big Think in July 2022. It was updated in March 2025.

The great thing about [philosophy](https://miniphilosophy.substack.com/) is that we can all do it. Anyone can ask philosophical questions about [reality](https://bigthink.com/thinking/is-human-consciousness-creating-reality/), [truth](https://bigthink.com/thinking/hardest-question-world-what-truth/), [right and wrong](https://bigthink.com/thinking/god-good-ethics-euthyphro-dilemma/), and the [point of it all](https://bigthink.com/thinking/philosophy-grief/), and we often do, at least for brief moments throughout the day. The best books, TV shows, and movies all come dyed in philosophy, and they plant ideas that linger long after you close the book or the screen fades to black.

But even though anyone can do philosophy (small “p”), it’s also true that not everyone is great at _Philosophy_ (big “P”, and as a discipline). When you study _Philosophy_, only a small part — a part often reserved for the wise and wizened ones of university departments — involves _doing_ philosophy. The rest is spent learning what other philosophers said and why they said it. It makes sense, of course. When you learn to draw or write, you first learn the basic techniques. You need to walk before you can run.

The problem is that the internet is awash with half-read and mostly misunderstood philosophy. It is made up of a series of quotations — often from Nietzsche, Rumi, or Camus — ripped from a single line of a very complicated book. It’s wisdom, but out of context and stripped of nuance. The million-follower accounts on social media tear out pithy aphorisms from huge, well-argued tomes to broadcast the philosophical equivalent of “live, laugh, love”.

To help clear things up, and to make the point more fully, here are five of the most misunderstood quotations out there.

**Nietzsche**: _“God is dead”_

------------------------------

This quotation is much more powerful (and makes more sense) when you look at the parts which come afterward: “God remains dead! And we have killed him!”

After all, this quote isn’t really about God at all — it’s about humanity, what we’ve done, and what those actions mean.

When Nietzsche says, “God is Dead!”, it is not the triumphant cheer of a dragon-slaying hero, or a smug, cross-armed atheist at the back of the church. It’s more like the worried whispers of a eulogy. God, in this case, refers to the magnetic pole around which we all lived, and not some bearded, beneficent figure of myth.

Before the Enlightenment started introducing science and rationality to the masses, God meant certainty, truth, security, and purpose. He was the alpha and omega; the answer to all life’s questions. He was the great parent who lets the world make sense. Without God, Nietzsche goes on to say, it’s as if we’re falling, with no sense of up or down. There’s nothing to grab onto and nothing to steady us, at all.

“God is dead” is about how we reorient ourselves in a world that no longer revolves around God. How are we to make sense of things when all our explanations are suddenly gone?

**Ockham**: _“Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily”_

---------------------------------------------------------------

If I asked you to give your top three philosophical razors, I bet Ockham’s would rank high on the list. People often assume that Ockham’s razor is making the claim that “if something is simpler, then it’s more likely to be true” — as if simplicity is proportional to truth. But that’s not what it’s intended to do. Ockham’s razor is not meant to be a _rule_, but rather a guiding principle when choosing between options. Essentially, it’s saying that if we are presented with two equally compelling theories, it’s more rational to believe the simpler.

But the biggest problem in how we understand Ockham’s razor is that it was never really meant for real-world things, like in the philosophy of science. When Ockham was writing, he was taking aim at what was, quite frankly, some pretty insane metaphysics. This was the time of angelology and of “[how many angels can dance on the head of a pin?”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_many_angels_can_dance_on_the_head_of_a_pin) It was pedantic, convoluted, and very weird. [Dun Scotus](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41963737#metadata_info_tab_contents), for instance, believed the extramental world was made up of 10 distinct metaphysical essences, and 10 was a modest number for the time.

Ockham was trying to get everyone to calm down a bit — to stop inventing millions of metaphysical entities when one or a few would be fine.

**Marx**: _Capitalism is completely bad_

----------------------------------------

This is more of an idea than a quote. For a lot of people unfamiliar with Marx, or those who have only glancingly read his works, he comes across as a bank-burning, barricade-building anti-capitalist. It’s no doubt that Marx did not _want_ capitalism, but that’s not to say he didn’t see the good side of it, too. In fact, he even recognized it as an important and essential part to history’s progress.

The opening section of his _Communist Manifesto_ is a long, if grudging, recognition of capitalism’s successes. Marx points out the greater industry, commerce, and communication networks; the educational provision; and the rule of law. Capitalism is what brings together warring and bickering peoples to form “one government, one code of laws, one national class-interest”. It forces xenophobic, pariah peoples with an “obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate”. But the most important thing capitalism has done is to act as a kind of creative destruction.

Capitalism commodifies everything so that “all that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned”. It tears down the deities and sacred things of the past and replaces them with profit and industry. It’s this iconoclasm that will be the clean slate that allows an egalitarian restructuring of society. What’s more, capitalism’s fetishization of “profit” is what creates the surplus and productivity necessary for communistic redistribution of resources. Communism is not parachuted in as its own thing, but rather grows out from late-stage capitalism.

Of course, for Marx, capitalism is a “naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation” of humanity. It’s riddled with problems and tends to bring out the worst in us. But it’s also a necessary evil along the way to a better era.

**Rousseau**: _“The noble savage”_

----------------------------------

This is a bit of a cheat, because rather than being “misunderstood” it is probably better to say this idea is “misattributed”. Rousseau’s “noble savage” idea is that, before we all began to live in cities and label ourselves “civilized”, humans were a naturally virtuous species. We were kind, social, and happy. Rousseau, it’s thought, used the phrase to show how modern society debased more than advanced human nature. “Civilization” is more corrupt than civilized.

Not only is the idea of “savages” versus “civilization” a massively dated, [racist](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pprf8), and colonial notion, but the big problem is that Rousseau never said it. He likely didn’t believe it, either. Rousseau argued that we couldn’t call pre-societal people good or bad, virtuous or vicious, because these ideas evolved along with civilization. Our conception of what is right is formulated or given to us by the society to which we belong. To refer to a “noble savage” would amount to projecting our own values onto a pre-value people. Before civilization, humans were neither moral nor immoral. They were just natural.

**Descartes**: _Cogito Ergo Sum, or “I think, therefore I am”_

--------------------------------------------------------------

I admit, this one is a bit niche. First of all, “I think, therefore I am” most certainly does _not_ mean, “if you believe it, you can do it”. Rene Descartes was not a 17th-century French version of Dale Carnegie writing self-help books to fuel his [robot slave addiction](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/modern-intellectual-history/article/mechanical-daughter-of-rene-descartes-the-origin-and-history-of-an-intellectual-fable/14518C7D691F1B35B7504418B935D8A1). Instead, this was his attempt to resolve radical skepticism, which is that “how can we be sure of anything?!” question.

The basic point is that if I am thinking right now — or if I am doubting, to be precise — then it must also be that I am existing. A non-existent thing cannot think.

The misunderstanding comes in assuming this is an _argument_ in the form of premises (I think) to conclusion (I exist). Admittedly, the “therefore” does rather lure you in. Instead, the Cogito is an “a priori intuition” — that is to say, it is true simply by thinking on it. It is more like saying “there is a triangle, therefore there’s a three sided shape”. It is not an argument but rather a statement that contains certain truths within.

The reason that this is important, and not (only) some philosophical nitpick, is that in Descartes’ _Meditations_ he is quite explicit that we have no grounds for thinking our rationality is faultless. Our ability to find truth within arguments could just be the trick of some all-powerful demon.

As Descartes writes, “how do I know that I am not deceived every time that I add two and three, or count the sides of a square?” So, we cannot rely on our logic. This is why the Cogito — if it is to act as a way out of his skepticism — cannot be an argument.

**Look a little deeper**

------------------------

As we can see, it’s rare (and highly unlikely) that the entire canon of the greatest minds in history can be summarized, or understood, in a beautifully lettered Pinterest post. It’s almost always the case that if you take the time to search for the full context of a quotation, you will find much more to it. At the very least, you’ll find detail and nuance, and a lot of the time, you’ll find something completely different to your first impressions.

But, of course, that’s not what a lot of people like to do. Quotations, especially the popular ones, act as a kind of magic mirror in which we see what we want to see. And, to be honest, if it gets people thinking and talking, there’s not much harm in that, either.

Simon Schama: The Road to Auschwitz review – this gripping show isn’t afraid to ask awkward questions | Television | The Guardian

It is 80 years since the liberation of Auschwitz. That means it won’t be long before all the people who lived through the Holocaust are gone. It is now left to those who weren’t there – such as the historian [Simon Schama](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/simon-schama), born in London two weeks after the liberation – to ensure it is never forgotten or misremembered, and to preserve its lessons for future generations.

But how to go about it? In his new show, one of Schama’s main methods is to unflinchingly relive the depravity. The Road to Auschwitz holds you in its grip and forces you to absorb the details. We hear of Jewish people being murdered using high-pressure water hoses. We see photographs of the cramped, repellent ghettoes, in which they were starved until they resembled walking skeletons as children froze to death in the streets. We see the piles of shrivelled corpses in Auschwitz. We hear that the slaughter was so prolific that the camp’s purpose-built crematoriums became clogged with fat; in Schama’s words, “the furnaces were gagging”. An inmate of Auschwitz – who buried his testimony in the ground before he perished – describes the burning of corpses: the skin blisters and bursts in seconds, the stomach explodes, blue flames come out from the eye sockets, the head burns longest.

Told in this way, the Holocaust will never not be shocking to the point of utter incomprehensibility. But The Road to Auschwitz is also concerned with how the murder of Jewish people on an industrial scale was tolerated by Europe as a whole. This is not a journey back to the advent of antisemitism (that was a subject for Schama’s 2013 series, The Story of the Jews), although centuries of hatred obviously played a key role. Instead, Schama returns to the early years of the second world war.

First, he visits Kaunas in Lithuania, occupied by Germany in 1941. There, a local rabbi was decapitated before Jews were killed in the town centre as their neighbours watched. A local film-maker has spent decades interviewing witnesses, including a man who remembers crying at the spectacle as a child – because he couldn’t get a clear view. In footage seemingly from the 1990s, a woman shows off her gold tooth, which was wrenched from the mouth of a Jewish person. She seems to be repressing a smile.

Lithuania was a test case for the Nazis – it proved, we hear, that there was a voracious appetite for the murder of Jews. The allies knew what the Nazis were doing in eastern Europe, but believed it could never happen in “tolerant” Britain. This is one misapprehension that still needs to be corrected, and by examining how the Holocaust took hold in the Netherlands – which had hitherto been the safest place in Europe for Jews – Schama lands on an extremely effective way of doing so. Initially, the Dutch deplored German antisemitism, “doffing their hats” to those forced to wear yellow stars and putting them at the front of queues. They even staged a widespread strike against their persecution. In the end, it didn’t make any difference: the public became fearful of their new overlords and 75% of Dutch Jews were murdered. The moral is simple: no country is immune to the forces of fascism.

Yet there are moments in this documentary when the very act of remembering the Holocaust feels hopelessly complicated. Schama’s decision to retell it via graphic depictions of the violence and horror does an important job: it ensures the Holocaust continues to rank as one of the very worst events in human history. However, the events in the Netherlands suggest the power of sympathy is negligible. Rather than naked fear or a vicarious sense of personal trauma, “pity is what others \[who\] aren’t Jews feel” about the Holocaust, says Schama, standing on the site of Auschwitz for the first time in his life. “Screw the pity.”

What should go in its place is a question this programme doesn’t answer, unless you count a close synonym. Schama spends much of this documentary bumping up against the limits of language when attempting to articulate his response to the atrocity; “deeply distressing” is sometimes the best English can do. He gives the final word to the Holocaust survivor Marian Turski, who died in February this year. “Evil comes step by step,” says Turski. “And therefore you shouldn’t be indifferent. Let’s start with reducing hatred.” He reads from a poem: “The most important thing is compassion. Its absence dehumanises.” Pity, compassion, sympathy: they can’t fight fascism alone – but a world without them doesn’t bear thinking about.

A ‘Path of Perfect Lawlessness’ - The Atlantic

The Trump administration’s arguments in a high-profile immigration case have much broader implications.

![Black-and-white photo of the Supreme Court building](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/5QGbWjkiHbVzn_bjPboAZy-dYE8=/0x0:7008x3942/960x540/media/img/mt/2025/04/2025_03_SerwerLawlessness/original.jpg)

April 7, 2025, 4:51 PM ET

The Supreme Court is about to decide whether the Trump administration can exile Americans to a Gulag overseas and then leave them there.

The Trump administration wants everyone to believe that the case challenging its deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador’s infamous Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, is about the government’s right to deport undocumented immigrants, or gang members, or terrorists. But it’s actually about whether the United States government can kidnap someone off the street and then maroon them, incommunicado, in a [prison abroad with little hope of release](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/trump-deportations-el-salvador/682267/). Human-rights groups [have said that](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/03/venezuela-trump-deportation-el-salvador-prison-human-rights-cecot-due-process/) they have yet to find anyone freed from CECOT, and the Salvadoran government has previously said anyone imprisoned there will “[never leave](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/17/g-s1-54206/el-salvador-mega-prison-cecot).”

Today, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to lift a federal-court order telling the administration to retrieve Abrego Garcia. This afternoon, Chief Justice John Roberts [blocked the order temporarily, pending further decision](https://bsky.app/profile/mjsdc.bsky.social/post/3lmapzrvc7s2u). As [my colleague Nick Miroff reported](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/an-administrative-error-sends-a-man-to-a-salvadoran-prison/682254/), the Trump administration acknowledged in court that Abrego Garcia was deported because of an “administrative error.” Abrego Garcia has been in the U.S. since he was 16, having fled El Salvador and come to the U.S. illegally after gangs threatened his family. He is married to an American citizen and has a 5-year-old child. In 2019, a judge gave him a protected status known as “withdrawal of removal,” ordering the government not to send him back to El Salvador. The Trump administration has alleged that Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, based on the [word of a single anonymous informant six years ago](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/an-administrative-error-sends-a-man-to-a-salvadoran-prison/682254/) and the fact that Abrego Garcia was wearing Chicago Bulls attire.

[Adam Serwer: Trump’s Salvadoran Gulag](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/trump-deportations-el-salvador/682267/)

In its majority opinion rejecting the government’s argument, though, judges from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals [wrote that the record](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca4.178258/gov.uscourts.ca4.178258.13.0_1.pdf) “shows that Abrego Garcia has no criminal history, in this country or anywhere else, and that Abrego Garcia is a gainfully employed family man who lives a law abiding and productive life,” and that “if the Government wanted to prove to the district court that Abrego Garcia was a ‘prominent’ member of MS-13, it has had ample opportunity to do so but has not—nor has it even bothered to try.” Abrego Garcia is not an exception—an [analysis by CBS News found](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-records-show-about-migrants-sent-to-salvadoran-prison-60-minutes-transcript/) that three-quarters of the more than 200 men deported to El Salvador lacked criminal records.

Even though the Trump administration conceded that Abrego Garcia was deported by mistake, it is insisting that federal courts cannot order his return. “A judicial order that forces the Executive to engage with a foreign power in a certain way, let alone compel a certain action by a foreign sovereign, is constitutionally intolerable,” it said in a court filing. The implications of this argument may not be immediately obvious, but if federal courts cannot order the return of someone exiled to a foreign Gulag by mistake, then the administration is free to exile citizens and then claim that they did so in error, while leaving them to rot.

As the legal scholar [Steve Vladeck wrote](https://perma.cc/7GFQ-6V6A), “A world in which federal courts lacked the power to order the government to take every possible step to bring back to the United States individuals like Abrego Garcia is a world in which the government could send _any of us_ to a Salvadoran prison without due process, claim that the misstep was a result of ‘administrative error,’ and thereby wash its hands of any responsibility for what happens next.” If the Trump administration prevails here, it could disappear anyone, even an American citizen. Several have already been [swept up and detained](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/04/05/us-citizens-deported-immigration/) in recent ICE raids. Whether you can imagine yourself in Abrego Garcia’s position or not, all of our fates are ultimately tied to his.

Deporting people without due process is what’s actually “constitutionally intolerable,” given that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee due process of law. Disappearing people off the street and exiling them is “constitutionally intolerable” for the same reasons. Sending people who have never been convicted of any crime to CECOT, a prison where advocates allege that inmates are routinely abused, may also be “constitutionally intolerable,” given the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. But whatever their constitutional status, all of these things should be _morally_ intolerable to any decent human being.

[Read: An ‘administrative error’ sends a Maryland father to a Salvadoran prison](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/an-administrative-error-sends-a-man-to-a-salvadoran-prison/682254/)

This should be one of those cases in which the justices are unanimous. If the Constitution’s commitments to due process mean anything, they should mean that the government cannot send people to be imprisoned by a foreign nation without a shred of evidence that they’ve committed any crime. American “history and tradition” produced a system designed to reject arbitrary powers such as these, with [the conscious fear that “parchment barriers”](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/historic-document-library/detail/thomas-jefferson-and-james-madison-correspondence-on-a-bill-of-rights) would provide little protection against an “overbearing majority” willing to violate rights. Nevertheless, I have little doubt that someone will try to argue that the Framers who wrote two due-process clauses into the Constitution actually loved disappearing people to foreign prisons.

“The facts of this case thus present the potential for a disturbing loophole: namely that the government could whisk individuals to foreign prisons in violation of court orders and then contend, invoking its Article II powers, that it is no longer their custodian, and there is nothing that can be done,” Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was appointed to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, wrote in his concurrence. “It takes no small amount of imagination to understand that this is a path of perfect lawlessness, one that courts cannot condone.”

This is eloquent and correct, but this lawlessness is happening precisely because the nation’s highest court condoned it in advance. The right-wing justices on the Roberts Court have repeatedly rewritten the Constitution to Donald Trump’s benefit, first by nullifying the anti-insurrection [clause in the Fourteenth Amendment](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/03/supreme-court-trump-v-anderson-fourteenth-amendment-originalism/677636/) and then by [inventing an imperial presidential immunity](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/supreme-court-donald-trump-immunity-decision/678859/) that is [nowhere in the text of the document](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/roberts-supreme-court-2024-term/678983/). It is no surprise that Trump is now acting as though he is above the law. After all, the Roberts Court all but granted him permission.

When I joined the conservative movement in the 1980s, there were two types of people: those who cared earnestly about ideas, and those who wanted only to shock the left. The reactionary fringe has won.

Charles de Gaulle began [his war memoirs](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781668061206) with this sentence: “All my life I have had a certain idea about France.” Well, all my life I have had a certain idea about America. I have thought of America as a deeply flawed nation that is nonetheless a force for tremendous good in the world. From Abraham Lincoln to Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan and beyond, Americans fought for freedom and human dignity and against tyranny; we promoted democracy, funded the Marshall Plan, and saved millions of people across Africa from HIV and AIDS. When we caused harm—Vietnam, Iraq—it was because of our overconfidence and naivete, not evil intentions.

Until January 20, 2025, I didn’t realize how much of my very identity was built on this faith in my country’s goodness—on the idea that we Americans are partners in a grand and heroic enterprise, that our daily lives are ennobled by service to that cause. Since January 20, as I have watched America behave vilely—toward our friends in Canada and Mexico, toward our friends in Europe, [toward the heroes in Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/zelensky-trump-putin-ukraine/681883/) in the Oval Office—I’ve had trouble describing the anguish I’ve experienced. Grief? Shock? Like I’m living through some sort of hallucination? Maybe the best description for what I’m feeling is moral shame: To watch the loss of your nation’s honor is embarrassing and painful.

George Orwell is a useful guide to what we’re witnessing. He understood that it is possible for people to seek power without having any vision of the good. “The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake,” an apparatchik says in [_1984_](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780451524935). “We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power.” How is power demonstrated? By making others suffer. Orwell’s character continues: “Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation.”

Russell Vought, Donald Trump’s budget director, sounds like he walked straight out of _1984_. “When they wake up in the morning, [we want them to not want to go to work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBH9TmeJN_M&t=12s), because they are increasingly viewed as the villains,” he said of federal workers, speaking at an event in 2023. “We want to put them in trauma.”

Since coming back to the White House, Trump has caused suffering among Ukrainians, suffering among immigrants who have lived here for decades, suffering among some of the best people I know. Many of my friends in Washington are evangelical Christians who found their vocation in public service—fighting sex trafficking, serving the world’s poor, protecting America from foreign threats, doing biomedical research to cure disease. They are trying to live lives consistent with the gospel of mercy and love. Trump has devastated their work. He isn’t just declaring war on “wokeness”; he’s declaring war on Christian service—on any kind of service, really.

If there is an underlying philosophy driving Trump, it is this: Morality is for suckers. The strong do what they want and the weak suffer what they must. This is the logic of bullies everywhere. And if there is a consistent strategy, it is this: Day after day, the administration works to create a world where ruthless people can thrive. That means destroying any institution or arrangement that might check the strongman’s power. The rule of law, domestic or international, restrains power, so it must be eviscerated. [Inspectors general](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/08/trump-attacks-inspector-general-glenn-fine/679596/), [judge advocate general officers](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/trump-jag-military-lawyers-fired/681888/), [oversight mechanisms](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/03/hampton-dellinger-whistlebower-office-special-counsel/681995/), and watchdog agencies are a potential restraint on power, so they must be fired or neutered. The truth itself is a restraint on power, so it must be abandoned. Lying becomes the language of the state.

Trump’s first term was a precondition for his second. His first term gradually eroded norms and acclimatized America to a new sort of regime. This laid the groundwork for his second term, in which he’s making the globe a playground for gangsters.

We used to live in a world where ideologies clashed, but ideologies don’t seem to matter anymore. The strongman understanding of power is on the march. Power is like money: the more the better. Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the rest of the world’s authoritarians are forming an axis of ruthlessness before our eyes. Trumpism has become a form of nihilism that is devouring everything in its path.

The pathetic thing is that I didn’t see this coming even though I’ve been living around these people my whole adult life. I joined the conservative movement in the 1980s, when I worked in turn at _National Review_, _The Washington Times_, and _The Wall Street Journal_ editorial page. There were two kinds of people in our movement back then, the conservatives and the reactionaries. We conservatives earnestly read Milton Friedman, James Burnham, Whittaker Chambers, and Edmund Burke. The reactionaries just wanted to shock the left. We conservatives oriented our lives around writing for intellectual magazines; the reactionaries were attracted to TV and radio. We were on the political right but had many liberal friends; they had contempt for anyone not on the anti-establishment right. They were not pro-conservative—they were anti-left. I have come to appreciate that this is an important difference.

I should have understood this much sooner, because the reactionaries had revealed their true character as far back as January 1986. A group of progressive students at Dartmouth had erected a shantytown on campus to protest apartheid. One night, [a group of 12 students](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/12/us/dartmouth-suspends-12-for-attack-on-shanties.html), most of them associated with the right-wing _Dartmouth Review_, descended on the shanties with sledgehammers and smashed them down.

Even then I was appalled. Apartheid was evil, and worth opposing. A nighttime raid with sledgehammers seemed more Gestapo than Burkean. But conservative intellectuals didn’t take this seriously enough. In large part, I think this was because we looked down on the _Dartmouth Review_ mafia, whose members had included Laura Ingraham and Dinesh D’Souza. Their intellectual standards were so obviously third-rate. I don’t know how to put this politely, but they just seemed creepy—nakedly ambitious in a way that I thought would destroy them in the end.

[From the December 2024 issue: David Brooks on how the Ivy League broke America](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/12/meritocracy-college-admissions-social-economic-segregation/680392/)

Instead, history has smiled on them. A prominent publisher of right-wing authors once told me that the way to sell conservative books is not to write a good book—it’s to write a book that will offend the left, thereby causing the reactionaries to rally to your side and buy it. That led to books with titles such as _The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left_, and to Ann Coulter’s entire career. Owning the libs became a lucrative strategy.

Of course, the left made it easy for them. The left really did purge conservatives from universities and other cultural power centers. The left really did valorize a “meritocratic” caste system that privileged the children of the affluent and screwed the working class. The left really did pontificate to their unenlightened moral inferiors on everything from gender to the environment. The left really did create a stifling orthodoxy that stamped out dissent. If you tell half the country that their voices don’t matter, then the voiceless are going to flip over the table.

But although Trump may have campaigned as a MAGA populist, leveraging this working-class resentment to gain power, he governs as a Palm Beach elitist. Trump and Elon Musk are billionaires who went to the University of Pennsylvania. J. D. Vance went to Yale Law School. Pete Hegseth went to Princeton and Harvard. Vivek Ramaswamy went to Yale and Harvard. Stephen Miller went to Duke. Ted Cruz went to Princeton and Harvard. Many of Musk’s DOGE workers, according to _The New York Times_, [come from elite institutions](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html)—Harvard, Princeton, Morgan Stanley, McKinsey, Wharton. These are the Vineyard Vines nihilists, the spiritual descendants of the elite bad boys at the _Dartmouth Review_. This political moment isn’t populists versus elitists; it is, as I’ve written before, like a civil war in a prep school where the sleazy rich kids are taking on the pretentious rich kids.

[Derek Thompson: DOGE’s reign of ineptitude](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/musk-terror-reign/681731/)

The MAGA elite rode to power on working-class votes, but—trust me, I know some of them—they don’t care about the working class. Trump and his crew could have taken office with actual plans to make life better for working-class Americans. An administration that cared about the working class would seek to address its problems, such as the fact that [the poorest Americans die an average of 10 to 15 years younger than their higher-income counterparts](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4866586/), or that by sixth grade, many of the children in the poorest school districts have [fallen four grade levels behind those in the richest](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/29/upshot/money-race-and-success-how-your-school-district-compares.html). An administration that cared about these people would have offered a bipartisan industrial policy to create working-class jobs.

These faux populists have no interest in that. Instead of helping workers, they focus on civil war with their left-wing fellow elites. During Trump’s first months in office, one of their highest priorities has been to destroy the places where they think liberal elites work—the [scientific community](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/02/trump-science-data-gender-dei/681698/), the [foreign-aid community](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/usaid-dismantle-trump-damage/681644/), the [Kennedy Center](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/trump-america-cultural-revolution/681863/), the [Department of Education](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/02/what-does-the-department-of-education-actually-do/681597/), [universities](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/dei-letter-universities-trump/681986/).

It turns out that when you mix narcissism and nihilism, you create an acid that corrodes every belief system it touches.

This Trumpian cocktail has [eaten away at Christianity](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/01/evangelicals-trump/681450/), a faith oriented around the marginalized. Blessed are the meek. Blessed are the poor in spirit. The poor are closer to God than the rich. Again and again, Jesus explicitly renounced worldly power.

[Read: Evangelicals made a bad trade](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/01/evangelicals-trump/681450/)

But if Trumpism has a central tenet, it is untrammeled lust for worldly power. In Trumpian circles, many people ostentatiously identify as Christians but don’t talk about Jesus very much; they have crosses on their chest but Nietzsche in their heart—or, to be more precise, a high-school sophomore’s version of Nietzsche.

To Nietzsche, all of those Christian pieties about justice, peace, love, and civility are constraints that the weak erect to emasculate the strong. In this view, Nietzscheanism is a morality for winners. It worships the pagan virtues: power, courage, glory, will, self-assertion. The Nietzschean Übermenschen—which Trump and Musk clearly believe themselves to be—offer the promise of domination over those sick sentimentalists who practice compassion.

Two decades ago, Michael Gerson, a graduate of Wheaton College, a prominent evangelical institution, [helped George W. Bush start the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief](https://www.devex.com/news/he-came-up-with-the-name-michael-gerson-s-pepfar-legacy-104487), which has [saved 25 million lives](https://www.state.gov/results-and-impact-pepfar) in Africa and elsewhere. I traveled with Gerson to Namibia, Mozambique, and South Africa, where dying people had recovered and returned to their families, and were leading active lives. It was a proud moment to be an American. Vought—Trump’s budget director, who also graduated from Wheaton—[championed the evisceration of PEPFAR](https://x.com/russvought/status/1765796560615456900?lang=ar), which has now been set in motion by executive order, [effectively sentencing thousands to death](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/ANNALS-24-01104?journalCode=aim). Project 2025, of which Vought [was a principal architect](https://www.propublica.org/article/video-donald-trump-russ-vought-center-renewing-america-maga), helped lay the groundwork for [the dismantling of USAID](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-09.pdf); its gutting appears to have ended a program to supply malaria protection to 53 million people and [cut emergency food packages](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/health/usaid-contract-terminations.html) for starving children. Twenty years is a short time in which to have traveled the long moral distance from Gerson to Vought.

Trumpian nihilism has eviscerated conservatism. The people in this administration are not conservatives. They are the opposite of conservatives. Conservatives once believed in steady but incremental reform; [Elon Musk believes in rash and instantaneous disruption](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/doge-musk-catastrophic-risk/682011/). Conservatives once believed that moral norms restrain and civilize us, habituating us to virtue; Trumpism trashes moral norms in every direction, riding forward on a tide of adultery, abuse, [cruelty](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/trump-campaign-cruelty/680498/), immaturity, grift, and corruption. Conservatives once believed in constitutional government and the Madisonian separation of powers; Trump [bulldozes checks and balances](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1890831570535055759), declaiming on social media, “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” Reagan promoted democracy abroad because he thought it the political system most consistent with human dignity; the Trump administration couldn’t care less about promoting democracy—or about human dignity.

How does this end? Will anyone on the right finally stand up to the Trumpian onslaught? Will our institutions withstand the nihilist assault? Is America on the verge of ruin?

In February, about a month into Trump’s second term, I [spoke at a gathering of conservatives in London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSa52TR9tCA) called the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship. Some of the speakers were pure populist (Vivek Ramaswamy, Mike Johnson, and Nigel Farage). But others were center-right or not neatly ideological (Niall Ferguson, Bishop Robert Barron, and my _Atlantic_ colleague Arthur C. Brooks).

[David Brooks: Confessions of a Republican exile](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/10/trumpism-republican-party-exile-david-brooks/680243/)

In some ways, it was like the conservative conferences I’ve been attending for decades. I listened to a woman from Senegal talking about trying to make her country’s culture more entrepreneurial. I met the head of a charter school in the Bronx that focuses on character formation. But in other ways, this conference was startlingly different.

In my own talk, I sympathized with the populist critique of what has gone wrong in Western societies. But I shared with the audience my dark view of President Trump. Unsurprisingly, a large segment of the audience booed vigorously. One man screamed that I was a traitor and stormed out. But many other people cheered. Even in conservative precincts infected by reactionary MAGA-ism, some people are evidently tired of Trumpian brutality.

As the conference went on, I noticed a contest of metaphors. The true conservatives used metaphors of growth or spiritual recovery. Society is an organism that needs healing, or it is a social fabric that needs to be rewoven. A poet named Joshua Luke Smith [said we needed to be the seeds of regrowth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsiB9uCMZ68), to plant the trees for future generations. His incantation was beatitudinal: “Remember the poor. Remember the poor.”

But others relied on military metaphors. We are in the midst of civilizational war. “They”—the wokesters, the radical Muslims, the left—are destroying our culture. There were allusions to the final epochal battles in _The Lord of the Rings_. The implication was that Sauron is leading his Orc hordes to destroy us. We are the heroic remnant. We must crush or be crushed.

The warriors tend to think people like me are soft and naive. I tend to think they are catastrophizing narcissists. When I look at Trump acolytes, I see a swarm of Neville Chamberlains who think they’re Winston Churchill.

I understand the seductive power of a demagogue who tells you that the people who look down on you are evil. I understand the seductive power of being told that your civilization is on the verge of total collapse, and that everything around you is degeneracy and ruin. This message gives you a kind of terrifying thrill: The stakes are apocalyptic. Your life has meaning and urgency. Everything is broken; let’s burn it all down.

I understand why people who feel alienated would want to follow the leader who speaks about domination and combat, not the one who speaks about healing and cooperation. It doesn’t matter how many times you’ve read Edmund Burke or the Gospel of Matthew—it’s still tempting to throw away all of your beliefs to support the leader who promises to be “your retribution.”

America may well enter a period of democratic decay and international isolation. It takes decades to develop strong alliances, and to build the structures and customs of democracy—and only weeks to decimate them, as we’ve now seen. And yet I find myself confident that America will survive this crisis. Many nations, including our own, have gone through worse and bloodier crises and recovered. In [_Upheaval: Turning Points for Nations in Crisis_](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780316409148), the historian and scientist Jared Diamond provides case studies—Japan in the late 19th century, Finland and Germany after World War II, Indonesia after the 1960s, Chile and Australia during and after the ’70s—of countries that came back stronger after crisis, collapse, or defeat. To these examples, I’d add Britain in the 1830s and ’40s, and the 1980s, and South Korea in the 1980s. Some of these countries (such as Japan) endured war; others (Chile) endured mass torture and “disappearances”; still others (Britain and Australia) endured social decay and national decline. All of them eventually healed and came back.

America itself has already been through numerous periods of rupture and repair. Some people think we’re living through a period of unprecedented tumult, but the Civil War and the Great Depression were much worse. So were the late 1960s—assassinations, riots, a failed war, surging crime rates, a society coming apart. From January 1969 until April 1970, there were [4,330 bombings in the U.S., or about nine a day](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Riots_Civil_and_Criminal_Disorders/jMZEAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA5341). But by the 1980s and ’90s—after getting through Watergate, stagflation, and the Carter-era “malaise” of the ’70s—we had recovered. As brutal and disruptive as the tumult of the late 1960s was, it helped the country shake off some of its persistent racism and sexism, and made possible a freer and more individualistic ethos.

But the most salient historical parallel might be the America of the 1830s. Andrew Jackson is the American president who most resembles Trump—power-hungry, rash, narcissistic, driven by animosity. He was known by his opponents as “King Andrew” for his expansions of executive power. “The man we have made our President has made himself our despot, and the Constitution now lies a heap of ruins at his feet,” [Senator Asher Robbins of Rhode Island said](https://archive.org/details/trumpetsofgloryf0000hawk/page/160/mode/2up). “When the way to his object lies through the Constitution, the Constitution has not the strength of a cobweb to restrain him from breaking through it.” Jackson brazenly defied the Supreme Court on a ruling about Cherokee Nation territory (a defiance, it should be noted, that [Vice President Vance has explicitly endorsed](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/us/politics/jd-vance-donald-trump-2024-campaign.html)). “Though we live under the form of a republic,” [Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story wrote](https://archive.org/details/lifelettersofjos0002will/page/154/mode/2up), “we are in fact under the absolute rule of a single man.”

But Jackson made the classic mistake of the populist: He overreached. Fueled by personal hostility toward elites, he destroyed the Second Bank of the United States, an early precursor to the Federal Reserve System, and helped spark an economic depression that ruined the administration of his chosen successor, Martin Van Buren.

![illustration with top half of a torn portrait of Andrew Jackson's superimposed over the bottom half of a portrait of Donald Trump](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/zxIvhOs453Ljco0DRTPefFso8d0=/0x0:1375x1562/655x744/media/img/posts/2025/03/WEL_Brooks_ConservatismSpot/original.png)

In response to Jackson, the Whig Party arose in the 1830s to create a new political and social order. Devoutly anti-authoritarian, the Whigs were a cultural, civic, and political force all at once. They emphasized both traditional morality and progressive improvements. They agitated for prison reform and for keeping the Sabbath, for more women’s participation in politics and for a strong military, for government-funded public schools and for pro-business government policies. They were opposed to Jackson’s monstrous Indian Removal Act, and to the Democratic Party’s reactionary, white-supremacist social vision. Whereas Jacksonian Democrats emphasized negative liberty—_get your hands off me_—the Whigs, who would turn into the early Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln, emphasized positive liberty, empowering Americans to live bigger, better lives with things such as expanded economic credit, free public education, and stronger legal protections including due process and property rights.

Though we’ve come to call the early-to-mid-19th century the Age of Jackson, [the historian Daniel Walker Howe notes](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780195392432) that it was not Jackson but the Whigs who created the America we know today. “As economic modernizers, as supporters of strong national government, and as humanitarians more receptive than their rivals to talent regardless of race and gender,” Howe writes, the Whigs “facilitated the transformation of the United States from a collection of parochial agricultural communities into a cosmopolitan nation integrated by commerce, industry, information, and voluntary associations as well as by political ties.” Looking back, Howe concludes, we can see that even though they were not the dominant party of their time, the Whigs “were the party of America’s future.” To begin its recovery from Trumpism, America needs its next Whig moment.

Yes, we have reached a point of traumatic rupture. A demagogue has come to power and is ripping everything down. But what’s likely to happen is that the demagogue will start making mistakes, because incompetence is built into the nihilistic project. Nihilists can only destroy, not build. Authoritarian nihilism is inherently stupid. I don’t mean that Trumpists have low IQs. I mean they do things that run directly against their own interests. They are pathologically self-destructive. When you create an administration in which one man has all the power and everybody else has to flatter his voracious ego, stupidity results. Authoritarians are also morally stupid. Humility, prudence, and honesty are not just nice virtues to have—they are practical tools that produce good outcomes. When you replace them with greed, lust, hypocrisy, and dishonesty, terrible things happen.

[From the September 2023 issue: David Brooks on why Americans are so awful to one another](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/us-culture-moral-education-formation/674765/)

The DOGE children are doubtless brilliant in certain ways, but they know as much about government as I know about rocketry. They announced an $8 billion cut to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract—though [if they had read their own documents correctly](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/upshot/doge-contracts-musk-trump.html), they would have realized that the cut was less than $8 _million_. They eliminated workers from the National Nuclear Security Administration, apparently [without realizing that this agency controls nuclear security](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/02/doge-nuclear-worker-firings-musk-trump/), and had to undo some of those cuts shortly thereafter. Trump seems to be trying to give a bunch of Sam Bankman-Frieds access to America’s nuclear arsenal and IRS records. What could go wrong?

When Trump creates an unnecessary crisis, it’s unlikely to be a small one. The proverbial “adults in the room” who contained crises in Trump’s first term are gone. Whatever the second-term crisis—runaway inflation? a global trade war? a cratered economy and plummeting stock market? an out-of-control conflict in China? botched pandemic management? a true hijacking of the Constitution precipitated by defiance of the courts?—it is likely to crater his support and shift historical momentum.

But although Trumpism’s collapse is a necessary condition for national recovery, it is not a sufficient one. Its demise must be followed by the hard work necessary to achieve true civic and political renewal.

Progress is not always a smooth or merry ride. For a few decades, nations live according to one paradigm. Then it stops working and gets destroyed. When the time comes to build a new paradigm, progressives talk about economic redistribution; conservatives talk about cultural and civic repair. History shows that you need both: Recovery from national crisis demands comprehensive reinvention at all levels of society. If you look back across the centuries, you find that this process requires several interconnected efforts.

First, a national shift in values. In the late 19th century, for example, as the country went through the wrenching process of industrialization, America was traumatized by severe recessions and mass urban poverty. In response, social Darwinism gave way to the social-gospel movement. Social Darwinism, associated with thinkers such as Herbert Spencer, valorized survival of the fittest and claimed that the poor are poor because of inferior abilities. The social-gospel movement, associated with theologians such as Walter Rauschenbusch, emphasized the systemic causes of poverty, including the Gilded Age’s concentration of corporate power. By the early 20th century, most mainline Protestant denominations had [signed on to the Social Creed of the Churches](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Social_Creed_of_the_Churches/tHcAAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0), which called for, among other things, the abolition of child labor and the creation of disability insurance.

Second, nations that hang together through crisis have a strong national identity—they return to their roots. They have a leader who replaces the amoralism of the nihilists, or, say, the immorality of slavery, with a strong redefinition of the nation’s moral mission, the way Lincoln redefined America at Gettysburg.

Third, a civic renaissance. After the social gospel took root, Americans in the 1890s and early 1900s launched and participated in a series of social movements and civic organizations: United Way, the NAACP, the Sierra Club, the settlement-house movement, the American Legion.

Fourth, a national reassessment. As Jared Diamond notes, nations that turn around don’t catastrophize. Rather, they develop a clear-eyed view of what’s working and not working, and they pursue careful, selective change. According to Diamond’s research, the leaders of successful reform movements also take responsibility for their part in the crisis. For instance, Germany’s leaders accepted responsibility for the country’s Nazi past; Finland’s leaders took responsibility for an unrealistic foreign policy before World War II, when they had to deal with a looming Soviet Union on their border; and Australia’s leaders took responsibility in the 1970s for a political culture and foreign policy that had become overly dependent on Britain.

Fifth, a surge of political reform. In 1830s and ’40s Britain—racked by social chaos, bank failures, a severe depression, riots, and crushing wealth inequality—Prime Minister Robert Peel, a leader of great moral rectitude, built the modern police force, reduced tariffs, pushed railway legislation that literally laid the tracks for British industrialization, and helped pass the Factory Act of 1844, which regulated workplaces. In early-20th-century America, Progressives produced a comparable flurry of effective reforms that pulled the country out of its industrialization crisis.

Part of political reform is an expansion of the circle of power. What that would require in America today is, among other things, a broad effort to include working-class and conservative voices in what have traditionally been cultural bastions of elite progressivism—universities, the nonprofit sector, the civil service, the mainstream media.

[Derek Thompson: Abundance can be America’s next political order](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/abundance-americas-next-political-order/682069/)

Finally, economic expansion. Economic growth can salve many wounds. Pursuing [a so-called abundance agenda](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781668023488)—a set of policies aimed at reducing government regulation and increasing investment in innovation, and expanding the supply of housing, energy, and health care—is the [most promising way](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/abundance-americas-next-political-order/682069/) to achieve that expansion.

in the long term, Trumpism is doomed. Power without prudence and humility invariably fails. Nations, like people, change not when times are good but in response to pain. At a moment when Trumpism seems to be devouring everything, the temptation is to believe that this time is different.

But history doesn’t stop moving. Even now, as I travel around the country, I see the forces of repair gathering in neighborhoods and communities. If you’re part of an organization that builds trust across class, you’re fighting Trumpism. If you’re a Democrat jettisoning insular faculty-lounge progressivism in favor of a Whig-like working-class abundance agenda, you’re fighting Trumpism. If you are standing up for a moral code of tolerance and pluralism that can hold America together, you’re fighting Trumpism.

Over time, changes in values lead to changes in relationships, which lead to changes in civic life, which eventually lead to changes in policy and then in the general trajectory of the nation. It starts slow, but as the Book of Job says, the sparks will fly upward.

 Josephine Baker: the superstar turned spy who fought the Nazis and for civil rights | Josephine Baker | The Guardian

She was, according to US wartime counter-intelligence officer Lt Paul Jensen, “our No 1 contact in French Morocco”, supporting the allied mission “at great risk to her own life – and I mean that literally. We would have been quite helpless without her.”

The British intelligence agent Donald Darling had her down as an especially “cherished agent of \[Charles\] de Gaulle’s government”. Well aware of her importance, the UK foreign intelligence service MI6 called her “the pet lady agent” of the Free French.

Before the second world war, [Josephine Baker](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/josephine-baker) had been “the Black Venus”: the world’s first female superstar of colour, dancing the Charleston dressed in nothing but pearls and a banana skirt, parading her pet cheetah, scandalising and delighting _le Tout-Paris_.

After the war, Baker became a prominent and outspoken US civil rights campaigner, famously speaking with Martin Luther King Jr at the 1963 March on Washington and adopting 12 children from eight countries to live with her in her chateau in the Dordogne.

![Josephine Baker in military uniform with tens of thousands of people lining the National Mall](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e90b9bbb14f472581034749c1470e4a8eeec8a52/0_0_1950_1303/master/1950.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)

During it, she was a spy. Shrouded in the fog of war, then recounted afterwards – often unreliably – in the memoirs of people (including Baker herself) with a story to spin, the entertainer’s wartime exploits have long been a subject for speculation and mythmaking.

But a new account, working from contemporary, often unused sources, has uncovered evidence that Baker was not only a highly effective agent but was also using the same celebrity that provided the perfect cover for her espionage as a powerful means to promote the cause of equal rights.

“Looking at her life through the prism of the war really helps us understand who she was, and to make sense of what she did later on,” said Hanna Diamond, a professor of French history at Cardiff University and the author of [Josephine Baker’s Secret War](https://yalebooks.co.uk/book/9780300279986/josephine-bakers-secret-war/), which is published on Tuesday.

“The war was so important; it’s the missing piece of her puzzle. She \[Baker\] was amazingly well equipped to be a spy; a performer, through and through. Her motivation came from the huge debt she felt to [France](https://www.theguardian.com/world/france), which had made her a star – and it had its roots in the racism she grew up with.”

Born in 1906 in St Louis, Missouri, Baker left school at 12 and in 1921 was cast in an early all-Black musical on Broadway. Four years later, she won a place in a Paris show, La Revue Nègre, and set sail for France. She swiftly became a huge star.

By 1939, when she was recruited by Jacques Abtey, an initially sceptical French intelligence agent who would become her handler and on-off lover, Baker was Europe’s highest paid entertainer and one of its best-known female celebrities.

Abtey taught her the tricks of the spy trade, such as using invisible ink, but it was Baker’s far-reaching fame – which meant everyone, everywhere wanted to meet her – and easy charm (which ensured they also talked freely) that were her real espionage assets.

From early 1941, Baker, under the aegis of the French secret services, travelled from Marrakech, where she was based, to Lisbon, Madrid, Seville and Barcelona, and round north Africa, giving concerts, attending receptions – and gathering and passing top secret information to allied agents.

![Josephine Baker receives the Légion d’honneur and Croix de guerre in 1961](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e99a0b90baad0c6769138fa540b6192dbd9f70a/0_0_5616_3885/master/5616.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)

She proved expert enough at it to be awarded, after the war, the resistance medal and, belatedly, the Légion d’honneur with the military Croix de guerre.

Although precisely what was in the notes that she carried – often pinned to her bra – was, in many cases, officially unrecorded and remains unknown, Diamond’s research suggests that on several occasions it proved hugely valuable, and was sometimes critical.

Previously unused sources show, for example, that after the allied landings in north Africa in 1942, Baker and the local leaders she had cultivated played a crucial role aiding US counter-intelligence in Morocco, identifying Nazi spies and allowing hundreds of arrests.

“We now know she continued as a key intermediary between the French, Americans and Moroccans through 1943 and 1944,” Diamond said. “We’ve long known a little about her allied spying activities. But this role as a vital go-between is new.”

Similarly, contemporary sources show Baker’s well-documented postwar anti-racism campaign was already under way in the early 1940s. Her tours of US army camps across north Africa brought her face to face with the racial segregation she had left behind in 1925.

Press interviews from the time make her motivations for performing very clear: “I am doing all I can to help win the war effort,” she told the Chicago Defender in 1943, but also “to make people generally more appreciative and kinder to my race”.

Gaining acceptance from the troops for whom she was singing and dancing was about promoting racial tolerance at home, Baker told the Palestine Post that same year: “Every success that I have counts for my coloured brothers in America.”

In north Africa, Baker performed, unusually, for audiences of unsegregated US troops. Playing to British forces, she was also subject to ugly racist remarks, apparently from South African troops, UK armed forces entertainments officer Henry Hurford Janes recorded.

The question was existential, Diamond said. “Discrimination was behind her decision to stay in France. In Paris, she had distanced herself from the other African-American exiles. She wanted to be French and when the war came, unlike others who left France, she stayed to support her compatriots.”

Baker refused to perform in occupied Paris, however, moving to the Dordogne days before the Germans arrived and, later, on to Vichy-controlled Morocco. Her 1937 marriage to Jean Lion, which made her a French citizen, reinforced her views. Lion was Jewish and Baker helped his family escape the Germans. “She knew very well, at first-hand, what Nazi racism meant,” Diamond said.

By contrast, her ardent Gaullism – she corresponded frequently with the general long after the end of the war, the book reveals – and idealisation of France meant she kept largely quiet when its north African colonies strived for independence.

The French president referenced her wartime activities – which were a revelation to many.

“In France,” Diamond said, “she is mainly known as a music-hall star, and in the US as a civil rights activist.” A whole chapter – the spying missions, the concerts that raised large sums for the resistance, her subsequent uniformed service in the French air force – was far less familiar.

Having begun her research “somewhat sceptical”, Diamond said she finished it “convinced Baker actually was really very valuable. She may not always have known what she was transmitting, but she did what she was told, and she did her best.”

The picture that emerges, Diamond said, is of “an incredibly able, shrewd, committed” Black woman who “saw very clearly that she could exploit her celebrity for a cause and, often with very great courage, then just went ahead and did so”.

During the war, Baker mobilised her talent as a performer, on and off stage, for Free France. After it, she applied what she had learned, effectively harnessing her celebrity to protest against the racial segregation policies of her native country.

“Knowing more about her wartime experiences helps us see how she herself came to understand what she could achieve,” Diamond said. “It was the war – the intelligence work and the performing – that made her aware of her power.”

  - Whether you’re reading Virgil’s _Aeneid_ or watching _The Wizard of Oz_ or _Finding Nemo_, you are enjoying a story that borrows the _Odyssey_’s plot: a hero, separated from home and loved ones, must wander among strange peoples and fantastical places during a difficult and often dangerous journey before arriving at last to reclaim both family and homeland. As you make your way through Dante’s _Inferno_, J.D. Salinger’s _The Catcher in the Rye_, or Stephen King’s _Stand by Me_, you are following a metaphorical arc first traced by Homer: the journey through space and time as a symbol for intellectual growth and discovery, for a deepening appreciation of the relationship of the self to the world, for the trajectory, finally, that we all follow from birth to death. The most suspenseful and exciting of the Odyssey’s plot twists—when the hero finally returns, he is in disguise and can thus secretly test the loyalty of those he left behind—has been endlessly recycled, from authors such as Alexandre Dumas (_The Count of Monte Cristo_) to filmmakers such as Ridley Scott (_Gladiator_). And the climactic testing of the _Odyssey_’s hero, who must prove both his identity and his worthiness to assume his destined role by meeting a series of challenges both physical and mental, has resurfaced in modern epics like _Harry Potter_ and _Game of Thrones_.
  - In some ways, the _Odyssey_ needs no introduction: it is everywhere around us. Over the nearly thirty centuries since Homer’s thrilling epic about the hero Odysseus’s homecoming from the Trojan War began to circulate, its story, characters, and themes have become so tightly woven into the fabric of our literature and art, music and drama, that they seem to us inevitable, natural. It’s with a start that we recall that someone had to invent them.

  - Over the nearly thirty centuries since Homer’s thrilling epic…its story, characters, and themes have become so tightly woven into the fabric of our literature and art, music and drama, that they seem to us inevitable.
  - The _Odyssey_ bequeathed to the West entire genres. The poem’s fascination with the alien creatures and unfamiliar cultures that its wandering hero confronts was the seed from which both fantasy literature and science fiction would eventually blossom; _Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland_ and _Star Trek_ share strands of an Odyssean DNA. The _Odyssey_ also established the blueprint for the picaresque novel, whose rollicking narratives about sly characters barely scraping their way through a series of hair-raising escapades, from _Don Quixote_ to _The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn_, echo Odysseus’s progress from Troy (where the ingenious ruse he dreamed up, the Trojan Horse, won the war) through encounters with monsters, seductresses, and ghosts, to Ithaka, the home he strives so hard to reach. The marital drama of Odysseus and his wife, Penelope—a couple agonizingly separated, the man and woman each facing different kinds of peril, eventually reunited only after a tense test of wits proves to each that the other is an ideal mate—contains the germ of all romantic comedy. The pleasure readers experience when Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy finally come together at the end of _Pride and Prejudice_ is a direct descendant of an emotion experienced by Homer’s audience thirty centuries ago as they listened to a bard sing of the reunion of Ithaka’s royal couple, fully revealed to each other at last after a separation of twenty years.
  - The _Odyssey_ has provided inspiration for a number of important modernist and contemporary authors. James Joyce’s 1922 classic _Ulysses_ (the title uses the Roman name for Homer’s wandering hero) is composed of sections that are both named for and modeled on episodes of Homer’s epic: “Circe,” “Proteus,” “Lotos-Eaters,” and so forth. Motifs and characters from both the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ resurface in _Omeros_, a 1990 epic poem on themes of colonialism and the Atlantic slave trade by the St. Lucian writer Derek Walcott, winner of the Nobel Prize, while the American poet Louise Glück, also a Nobel laureate, examined a collapsing marriage through a retelling of the _Odyssey_ in her 1996 collection _Meadowlands_. More recently, numerous women writers have taken the epic’s female characters and reimagined the events of Homer’s story from their points of view. In books such as Margaret Atwood’s _Penelopiad_ and Madeline Miller’s _Circe_, the reorientation of narrative perspective reminds us that the ancient works, originally composed by men for primarily male audiences, are nonetheless rich in complex female characters whose literary potential is still being tapped.
  - The large themes of Homer’s epic have proved to be enduring ones. The poem’s presentation of Odysseus as someone whose desperation to return home is tempered by an endless curiosity about the strange places through which he wanders provokes questions about how we navigate between the allure of adventure and the satisfactions of home. The depiction of the poem’s protagonist as a gritty survivor who—in stark contrast to the haughty warriors of the _Iliad_, for whom dying young in battle is a fair price to pay for everlasting glory—will stoop to virtually anything in order to stay alive demands that we reevaluate what we mean by the word “hero.” Odysseus’s fraught interactions with immortals such as the nymph Kalypso, whose offer of eternal life and youth he rejects in favor of returning to his aging wife, force us, like the hero, to grapple with the meaning of mortality and the value of human love, even as his relationships with his wife, his bedmates, his son, and his father offer insights into the relations between men and women, parents and children. And the epic’s complex portrayal of its morally ambivalent main character—a man whose impressive intellectual gifts, technological expertise, and “godlike” cunning nonetheless very often leave destruction and sorrow in their wake—often reads like a dark parable about Western civilization itself.

  - The _Odyssey_ further displays a marked interest in a subject that some readers are more likely to associate with the work of twentieth-century modernist writers: the workings of language and rhetoric, the nature of poetry and literature. Odysseus’s expertise as a talented raconteur (and, when the occasion demands, an expert liar), along with the epic’s many scenes of him and other characters telling, exchanging, and enjoying a tale whose point is clearly self-serving, raises tricky questions about the uses of narrative and its relationship to truth. Meanwhile, the _Odyssey_’s frequent references to and depictions of poets, singers, and bards, along with repeated episodes in which professional bards—like Homer himself—give performances on whose formal qualities and emotional power other characters comment, can lend the proceedings a startlingly “meta,” even postmodern feel.
  - Strikingly modern, too, is the _Odyssey_’s sophisticated inquiry into the nature of identity. The vehicle for that investigation is the poem’s constantly shifting presentation of its chameleon-like hero, whose adeptness at both falsifying his appearance and fictionalizing his life story makes it almost impossible to trust what we think we know about him—and, hence, impossible to know who he is. The issue is slyly raised already in the _Odyssey_’s opening line, which avoids naming its protagonist, referring to him instead simply as “a man.” Not very helpfully, that same first line allots this nameless man precisely one adjective—_polytropos_, literally “having many twists and turns”—which, at once vague and yet suggestive of endless possibilities, seems intended simultaneously to illuminate and to confound our understanding of just who this man might be. Over the twelve thousand one hundred nine lines that follow that opening, we see so many “turns” or facets of this character that it sometimes feels as if he is becoming more, rather than less, difficult to grasp as his story proceeds.
  - \*
  - And so we can read the _Odyssey_ today with a bracing sense of déjà vu: we feel we know these narratives, we have met these characters, we recognize these themes. Yet the epic of Odysseus’s return is, in many ways, as unfathomably strange to us as the one-eyed giant Cyclops was to its hero. Its origins, even after centuries of scholarly investigations, are opaque, its poetic conventions sometimes off puttingly foreign, certain of its values passé when not outright repugnant.
  - Small wonder. The _Odyssey_ is the product of the civilization of Archaic Greece—that is, Greece before the classical era, before the “golden age” of Pericles, Greek tragedy, Athenian democracy, the Parthenon. That civilization flourished between around 750 BCE, when the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ likely began circulating, and around 500 BCE—the moment when the Athenian democracy was established. But the civilization described in the Odyssey had flourished another half millennium earlier, in the final stage of the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1600—1150 BCE). This was the civilization of Greek kingdoms such as Mycenae, Argos, Tiryns, and Pylos, of the luxurious and sophisticated cities of Knossos on Crete and of Troy in Asia Minor. These states, known as “palace-cultures,” were organized around a royal palace, or _megaron_, as the center of social, political, and economic activity, and each palace was presided over by its warrior-king. The principal characters in both the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ are such kings: Odysseus of Ithaka, Achilles of Phthía, Nestor of Pylos, Menelaos of Sparta, Agamemnon of Mycenae. Between 1200 and 1150 BCE, nearly all these cities were destroyed, probably as the result of both natural disasters (drought, earthquakes, fires) and of economic and political upheavals.

  - During the centuries after the fall of the Bronze Age palace-cultures—a period of such greatly reduced literacy and such minimal large-scale building and craft production that it was long referred to as Greece’s “Dark Ages”—the tales Homer would later tell about the Trojan War began circulating, aglow with idealized reminiscences of the civilization that had so suddenly vanished. These tales eventually coalesced into a grand sequence of epic verse narratives known as the Epic Cycle. Composed by various poets and together comprising many tens of thousands of lines and at least seventy-seven “books”—that is, papyrus scrolls—this cycle traced the arc of the war from its distant prehistory (the wedding of the parents of Achilles, the Greeks’ greatest warrior) through its proximate cause (the Trojan prince Paris’s seduction of Helen, the wife of the Spartan king Menelaos), to the events of the Trojan War itself, culminating in the Sack of Troy; and thereafter the adventures of a number of the Greek warriors as they returned home (related in an epic known as the _Nostoi_, or “Returns”). The final bizarre ramification of the cycle’s most attenuated plotline was the slaying of Odysseus, in his old age, by his son Telégonos, his child by the witch Circe, related in a work called the _Telegony_, at the conclusion of which Telégonos marries Penelope and Telémakhos marries Circe(!). Of this cycle, only fragments and summaries survive. The only two complete epics about the Trojan War that have come down to us are the _Iliad_, about events that took place during the final year of the war, and the _Odyssey_, about the _nostos_, or “return,” of one particular hero. Scholars continue to debate the relationship between those two epics and the Epic Cycle: which came first, and which inspired the other.
  - As distant as they were from each other, both the civilization that the _Odyssey_ commemorates and the civilization that produced the epic shared a number of features that are profoundly alien to modern sensibilities. For one thing, both were deeply patriarchal cultures. Although they played key roles in religion and cults, women had no political rights or status, could not own property, and were themselves often little more than chattel, objects of exchange whose chief role was to produce children and perform homely domestic tasks. (Even the queens in the Homeric epics, from Helen of Troy to Penelope, are often depicted engaged in spinning and weaving; so, too, the goddesses Kalypso and Circe.) The economies of these cultures, moreover, were based largely on the labor of enslaved people—prisoners taken in war, victims of forced abductions—who, like many of the slaves depicted in both the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_, spent their lives performing work both domestic and agricultural for masters who expected their loyalty as a matter of course. Hence, like other great works of literature from remote eras and different cultures, the Homeric epics present us with a classic conundrum: How can a work that seems to speak with such truth about so much that matters to us have been produced by a culture with certain institutions and values so alien to us? Only an attentive reading of the poem can begin to forge an answer to that question.
  - As to the poem’s formal conventions, they are likely to strike modern readers as equally inscrutable. You don’t have to progress very far into the text before you notice a number of peculiarities unlike anything familiar from other literary encounters. Of these, the high degree of repetition is likely to be the most striking. Not only do most characters have descriptive epithets that are repeated nearly every time their names appear—“Athena of the bright owl-eyes,” “Telémakhos, sensible lad,” “Penelope, clear-thinking woman”—but entire lines and even whole passages are repeated, verbatim, throughout the poem. Scenes of feasting, for instance, nearly always include the line “Then they stretched out their hands toward the food that was spread before them,” while the end of the meal is just as regularly signaled by the phrase “But once they had put away their craving for drink and for food…” Between those two moments, Homer often repeats the following five-line passage, describing the dinner preparations and service:
  - A maidservant brought in water, pouring it out from a ewer—
  - Exquisite, wrought in gold—into a basin of silver,
  - For the guest to wash his hands. Then she placed a table nearby.
  - The housekeeper, worthy woman, brought the meal and served it,
  - Glad to have so many dishes to set out from her storerooms inside.

  - Such devices were, in fact, almost certainly the products of the distinctive manner in which the epics were composed and transmitted—which is to say, not in writing but orally. The texts of both epics were long thought to have been the work of a single genius named Homer, who wrote his poems. Scholars began to reconsider the origins of the poems, however, in the late eighteenth century, when a manuscript of the Iliad containing not only the text of the epic but transcriptions of the “scholia”—the marginal notes by various ancient commentators that had accreted over the centuries—was discovered in Venice. These precious annotations were of enormous value in their own right, since relatively little has survived of the vast body of ancient scholarship and commentary on Homer, which was often impressively erudite. (The Roman geographer Strabo, a contemporary of the emperor Augustus, makes reference to a thirty-volume work by someone called Demetrius of Skepsis that treated just sixty-two lines of the second book of the _Iliad_.) But what was so exciting about the marginalia in the Venetian manuscript was that many of the notes, which referred to a number of ancient editions of the poems, concerned questions that the ancient commentators had about the authenticity of certain lines and passages. If the epics had been penned by a single author, scholars wondered, why were there so many variants already in ancient times? Could the authentic text by Homer be recovered by judiciously sifting through the variant versions?
  - By the early nineteenth century, the Venetian manuscript and the writings of those who had studied it were roiling the intellectual and literary worlds by raising a different set of questions. What if there were no authentic Homeric versions of the poems—what if, indeed, there had been no Homer in the first place? As the century progressed, more and more classicists were persuaded that the epics must originally have been composed by illiterate oral poets in an era before the Greeks adopted an alphabet and writing became widespread; the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_, they argued, could not have been the work of a single bard but instead represented an accumulation of smaller, self-contained poems (or “lays”) composed by different poets of different eras. Adherents of one school of thought, known as “Analysts”—from the Greek word _analyô_, “to break \[something\] down into its component parts”—claimed to be able to distinguish among the various strata of composition in each of the epics; some insisted that they could make out “original” versions of the poems lurking beneath the layers. The Analysts were opposed by so-called “Unitarians,” who continued to insist that the poems, whatever flaws in consistency and irregularities in style and coherence they might occasionally display, were the product of a single genius.
  - The debate about the authorship and transmission of the epics, known as the “Homeric Question,” raged on into the twentieth century. In the 1920s and 1930s, a classicist named Milman Parry proposed a theory, based on an insight he had into Homer’s verbatim repetitions, that transformed the way we understand how the epics were composed. Parry suggested that those repeated lines, passages, and epithets—the latter almost always occurring in the same position within a line of verse—must have functioned as prefabricated placeholders for oral poets who composed their works in performance. The rigidly formulaic nature of the repetitions, he argued, were traces of a poetic process that combined memorization of traditional elements with improvisation: if the bard knew in advance how a line was going to end—“Zeus, who marshals the clouds,” say—or could count on being able to insert a formulaic passage of several lines, he could devote his energies to what we might think of as the “creative” parts. (It is worth noting, however, that within an oral tradition, a poet’s canny manipulation of traditional formulas and scenes could itself be considered creative.) Parry bolstered his hypothesis by drawing parallels between Homer’s epics and the epic verse of contemporary Yugoslav bards whom he had studied, who adapted and improvised on traditional material in the way he believed the Homeric performers may well have done.
  - Whatever the controversies about the identity of the epics’ poet (or poets)…there has never been disagreement, either ancient or modern, about the importance of the two Homeric epics.
  - Most contemporary classicists, it seems safe to say, accept Parry’s core theory about the oral tradition in which the Homeric epics evolved. The poems likely began as relatively short compositions by preliterate bards who drew on traditional material—legends about the Trojan War, folklore about stock figures (wily tricksters, man-eating ogres, sage old kings), myths about the various gods—to fashion their songs. With each performance, they might elaborate on earlier compositions, refining and adding, even as they continued to rely on and employ traditional diction, epithets, and stock phrases and scenes. (Passages in the poem where a given epithet fits the meter but doesn’t fit the occasion were, according to Parry, traces of the poems’ origins as oral performances) As successive generations of poet-performers kept adding new material to their own and their peers’ works, individual lays—Achilles’ quarrel with Agamemnon over the enslaved captive Briseis, say, or Odysseus’s encounter with the Cyclops—presumably began to coalesce into larger works with grander arcs and themes: the climactic struggles of the Trojan War and what they tell us about the nature of human striving and mortality, Odysseus’s return from the war after twenty years and what it tells us about time and identity, family and home. Eventually, these increasingly vast works were committed to writing, possibly by a gifted poet-editor who collated the various versions known to him and assembled them into something like their present form.
  - Just when this happened is, typically, up for debate. One theory that was long prevalent—based, in part, on comments by ancient authors such as Cicero—was that the first definitive written texts of the epics were compiled in the late 500s BCE on the orders of the Athenian ruler Peisístratos, who was keen to institute a recitation of the epics as part of a grand civic festival known as the Panathenaia. (For some scholars, this explains why a minor character in the Odyssey is called Peisístratos: an ingratiating nod to the event’s sponsor.) Such festivals, along with religious occasions, funeral games, and Panhellenic gatherings such as the quadrennial athletic games, were important venues for public recitations of the epics as well as other works. These performances, quite different from the intimate recitals in the courts of kings and nobles that are depicted in the epics themselves, were a vital part of Greek cultural life from the Archaic period on. The men who performed the recitations were known as _rhapsodes_, a term likely derived from the Greek verb “to stitch together,” presumably because they would piece together the mythic and folkloric material they inherited, the lays and various episodes, the traditional lines and formulas, into their compositions.

  - Ancient texts refer to a law enacted by a son of Peisístratos requiring that the epics be performed in their entirety at the Panathenaia, each work being divided into parts that were assigned to the _rhapsodes_ by lot, with successive _rhapsodes_ reciting the different sections in order. For this to happen, of course, there needed to be a fixed text. And yet, it is clear that numerous versions and variants continued to circulate and the poems continued to evolve. Starting in the early 200s BCE, the plethora of such variants in the collections of the Library of Alexandria convinced the scholars who worked there that it was imperative to create a definitive critical edition of the poems. The version they and their successors produced eventually became the basis of a standard edition, widely circulated throughout the classical world and eventually copied and recopied by hand over the next millennium and a half, until the invention of the printing press. The first printed edition of the _Odyssey_ was published in 1488, in Florence.
  - All this helps to explain why the existence of “Homer”—the blind bard who, people thought for centuries, single-handedly composed both the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_—is now questioned. Today, the name has become a convenient way of referring to all the obscure processes by means of which a loose collection of legends about the Trojan War and its aftermath were transformed, over time, into the two great epics we have today: masterpieces of astonishing structural complexity and coherence, great dramatic power, and profound insight into the human condition. (I will use “Homer” in this way.) Indeed, whatever the controversies about the identity of the epics’ poet (or poets), whatever the debates about the date and manner of their composition, there has never been disagreement, either ancient or modern, about the importance of the two Homeric epics.
  - Through two millennia of Greek civilization, they remained the twin foundations of Hellenic culture, from the Archaic Era through the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, twenty centuries later: an essential part of education, the inspiration or models for much if not most subsequent literary and dramatic works, revered as sources of insight into subjects from ethics to medical treatments, and enjoying the supreme status and exerting the pervasive influence on Western culture that we associate with the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, which the Homeric poems eventually joined as the foundations of European civilization.

  - **MIRACLES AND WONDER: The Historical Mystery of Jesus**, by Elaine Pagels
  - ___
  - In 1835, a young German scholar named David Friedrich Strauss published an innovative study of the life of Jesus, titled simply “The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined.”
  - Strauss offered a new, mythographical reading of the Gospels, discounting the historical veracity of the miracles attributed to Jesus, but affirming their status as expressions of moral truth. The book was an international sensation, elevating its author to widespread fame and notoriety.

  - ![This is the cover of “Miracles and Wonder” by Elaine Pagels](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/04/01/books/01elaine-pagels-cover/01elaine-pagels-cover-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale)
  - Though hardly the first author to try to understand the central figure of Christianity by scientific, historical and other rationalist means, Strauss particularly intrigued and enraged readers by suggesting that these methods be brought out of the academy and into the world of public discourse and religious practice. The truth of the historical Jesus and his life was not, in other words, just a scholarly debate, but a burning question that each individual, and society as a whole, must answer: not just how to be a Christian, but whether to be one at all.
  - Elaine Pagels, the best-selling author and Princeton professor, explains her interest in the life of Jesus in much the same terms. She opens her new book, “Miracles and Wonder,” with an account of her youthful dissatisfaction with the milquetoast Methodism of her suburban-California youth, with the more richly sacramental yet dourly punitive Catholicism and, finally, with the firebrand evangelism of Billy Graham that, despite its apparent _joie de vivre_, indulged the same willingness to condemn nonbelievers to eternal hellfire. But there persisted in her a fascination with Jesus, from whose personal existence the whole imaginative galaxy of Christianity seems to have sprung.
  - The “quest” for Jesus, as the prominent 20th-century theologian Albert Schweitzer memorably called it, has taken on many forms. Pagels takes the historical approach — which, since Strauss’s day, has proliferated widely, transforming from a philosophical insurgency to a mainstay of academic and even theological inquiry — drawing on the Gospels, contemporaneous primary source accounts and centuries of academic research to answer the questions of who, in fact, Jesus was.
  - Undoubtedly, the most attention-grabbing of these has to do with the circumstances of Jesus’ birth. According to Pagels, the doctrine that says that Jesus was born of a virgin is likely a later insertion into the story by Gospel writers seeking to overcome the “inconvenient fact” of his presumed illegitimacy.
  - But unlike some of the early slander they were defending against — that Mary was promiscuous — Pagels also raises the possibility that the young mother was one of the many victims of marauding Roman soldiers who were then ravaging the area in which she was living. And, both classical and modern critics have pointed out that the original Hebrew of Isaiah 7:14, the prophecy that the Gospel writers cite to support their claim, makes reference not to a virgin, but literally to a young woman (_almah_).
  - Pagels’s tone is consistently sympathetic, attuned to the pressures and incentives under which the Evangelists were writing, even as she betrays the somewhat superior attitude of the rationalist toward the religious. In her language, “many of today’s scholars” would agree with Trypho, the Jewish philosopher who first broached the possibility of a mistranslation, while the faithful “have persisted in following” Justin Martyr, the philosopher-convert who defended the teaching of Mary’s virginity.
  - But despite the implied disparity here, the translation of _almah_ into “virgin” instead of “young woman” may not have been a matter of simple fideism — much less of quasi-conspiratorial track covering — considering the fact that it was not even originally Christian, but made by much earlier Jewish translators of the Hebrew Bible into Greek. (This text, the Septuagint, was known throughout the Mediterranean world, and may well have been the source for the Gospel writers’ understanding of Isaiah.)
  - Of course, this does not entirely address how and why the Gospels were written, much less how they came to us. To the contrary, it suggests still deeper questions about the status of different translations, who is capable of interpreting the word of God and what it means to receive texts whose sources are at the very least mysterious to us — theological questions.
  - Without asking _these_ questions, we risk assuming that we can immediately recognize the social and psychological contours of the stories as we receive them — and that these alone explain the texts’ possible meanings.
  - The story that Pagels presents is a detailed speculation that can be roughly summarized in Goethe’s saying that Christianity, having failed as a political revolution, became a moral one. The Jesus of “Miracles and Wonder” is primarily a Jewish radical whose death was allegorized by his posthumous followers and eventually transposed into the language of ethics on the one hand, and religious doctrine on the other.
  - In rendering the early days of this reconstruction, Pagels presents decisions concerning the Gospel story and Christian doctrine as contrived, if not conspiratorial. But the depth of spirituality she uncovers is profound, providing for two millenniums of art and poetry. Pagels’s appreciation for these riches, as well as for the irrecoverable gaps in the historical record, keeps “Miracles and Wonder” from mere iconoclasm, even if its basic perspective finds Christian orthodoxy unsupportable.
  - But however much the critical-historical mode is shaped by modern presuppositions, it is also forever linked to an essential claim: To announce that God has become human is to demand a historical as well as a theological perspective — and, ultimately, to try to understand each in light of the other. And even the most rigorously critical investigation eventually puts us back on the enriching, infuriating, unavoidable human task of discerning between varieties of testimony.

  -  The True Story of Appomattox and the Danger of Myths | TIME
  - >  Excerpt
  - > Historians have revealed that the story Americans long learned about the end of the Civil War was a myth.
  - ---
  - On March 27**,** President Donald Trump signed an [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/restoring-truth-and-sanity-to-american-history/), insisting that our history must “focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people.” At the root of Trump’s order was the belief that historians have pushed a “factually baseless ideology aimed at diminishing American achievement.”
  - Trump's order included critiques of historians “interrogating institutional racism” and an exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum which suggests that “\[s\]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.”
  - However, modern scholarship asks us to reckon honestly, and unflinchingly, with complex facts and not gloss over painful parts of our history. Trump’s order therefore raises the question: should Americans accept incomplete, or inaccurate, stories of national "greatness" in place of the messy realities of history?
  - The case of one of the famous moments in American history—Robert E. Lee’s surrender at Appomattox—dramatically illustrates the dangers of letting myth substitute for accurate history.
  - For generations, Americans learned the same basic story about the end of the Civil War. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, Va. In a sublime moment of selflessness, the two great leaders nobly transcended their differences and chose the path of peace and reconciliation. Grant paid homage to Confederate courage by setting lenient surrender terms, which let the defeated rebels go home unpunished. In a reciprocal show of respect, Lee handed over his ceremonial sword to Grant, only to have his counterpart return it. The two men effectively ended the war and set the stage for America’s rise as a world power.
  - This story, however, was never true. Instead, it originated in 19th-century Americans’ yearning for a swift reunion, which could sweep away the unresolved issues of the war. The story served as a resolution to help prove that America was unique and not destined to experience the interminable rivalries and miseries of the Old World.
  - But politically, Appomattox [settled nothing](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-history-of-the-american-civil-war/making-peace/10B83412EC4F81DC545EC5FE193EFF02). Rather than a time of reconciliation, Lee’s surrender was a moment in which a wide range of Americans, including both generals, staked rival political claims.
  - **Read More:** [Civil War History Shows the Danger of Comparing Trump to Jesus](https://time.com/6958203/civil-war-history-trump-jesus/)
  - Neither Grant nor Lee arrived at Appomattox expecting to heal, in one grand gesture, the fractured country. Both men were fierce warriors, deeply committed to their respective causes. Far from proposing lenient surrender terms to exonerate the Confederates, Grant did so in an effort to change their hearts and minds. He regarded the Union victory as one of right over wrong and wanted to secure Confederate repentance and compliance. The story that he handed back Lee’s sword was “the purest romance,” as Grant [later wrote](https://archive.org/details/personalmemoirso02ingran/page/494/mode/2up?q=%22purest+romance%22) in his memoirs.
  - Grant and his army believed that their victory vindicated the superiority of a free labor society over a slave labor society. African American Union regiments, which consisted mostly of men who had escaped slavery, felt their patriotic sacrifices had earned them the full rights of citizenship, including the right to vote. As William McCoslin of the 29<sup>th</sup> Regiment USCT put it in [a May 1865 letter](https://www.nps.gov/apco/learn/historyculture/united-states-colored-troops-at-appomattox.htm), “We the colored soldiers, have fairly won our rights by loyalty and bravery. ...shall we obtain them? If they are refused now, we shall demand them!”
  - Confederates, by contrast, recoiled from both of these ideas and had little interest in repentance. Instead, Lee tried to claim the moral high ground, asserting that the Union victory was [one of might over right](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/gen-robert-e-lee-farewell-address). The goal was to deny the victors a mandate to govern the vanquished.
  - His posture reflected the hope among most Confederates that their cause—one of establishing a slaveholding republic—might still somehow be vindicated. Confederate General William Nelson Pendleton [decried](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015070238624&seq=422&q1=wretches) the need to surrender to an army of “German, Irish, negro, and Yankee wretches,” men he and his fellow Confederates regarded as their social and racial inferiors.
  - Unsurprisingly, given their lack of remorse, the Confederates also tried to avoid any consequences for their rebellion. At Appomattox, Lee requested that the Union army issue each of his soldiers a printed parole pass to vouch that if they went home and observed the laws in force where they resided, they would “remain undisturbed.” In an interview with the _New York Herald_ a few weeks later, [Lee warned](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/1865-04-29/ed-1/seq-5/) that if the Yankee government adopted “arbitrary or vindictive or revengeful policies,” Southerners would consider the surrender terms breached and would renew the fight.
  - In Lee’s eyes, one goal of this “gentlemen’s agreement” with Grant was to hold the line against Black civil rights. Lee and his allies sought the restoration—not the reimagining—of the South. He wanted to turn back the clock to before abolitionists had challenged slavery and Southern rule. In the aftermath of Appomattox, ex-Confederates moved quickly, using propaganda, fraud, and terrorism, to preempt Black freedom and impose a system akin to slavery.
  - Both Congress and the Union army, however, were unwilling to see the slave South recreated in all but name. The army maintained a tenuous [occupation](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/opinion/sunday/the-dangerous-myth-of-appomattox.htm) of the region. Congress also moved to grant freedpeople civil rights protections—provoking vehement objections from white Southerners that such measures violated the terms of the surrender, namely the promise that they would “remain undisturbed.”
  - The dispute highlighted how the surrender meant two very different things to the victorious Union and defeated Confederates.
  - When Grant became president in 1869 and tried to crack down on the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups, ex-Confederates demonized him as a radical extremist who had betrayed his promises to Lee. They also turned on any white Southerner who had the temerity to support Grant and Reconstruction. [Confederate general James Longstreet](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/biographies/james-longstreet) became a pariah among white Southern conservatives because he had embraced the Republican Party and Black voting rights after the war. He had done so out of gratitude for Grant’s leniency at Appomattox.
  - This and [other evidence](https://history.brown.edu/news/2025-03-11/new-book-qa-michael-vorenberg) exposed the reality behind the myth that the Appomattox “gentlemen’s agreement” restored national harmony. Not only was the story untrue, but it quickly became a weapon for ex-Confederates as they tried to shape the postwar settlement. Spreading their version of the myth allowed Confederates to cast themselves as the innocent victims of Reconstruction—even as they sowed chaos and violence in the South.
  - When former Confederate general John Brown Gordon, who headed the Georgia KKK, [testified before Congress](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/ACA4911.0006.001/376?rgn=full+text;view=image;q1=appomattox%20f) in 1871 on the conditions in the Reconstruction South, he credited Lee and Grant with banishing the spirit of vengeance. The problem, he falsely asserted, was insurrectionary Southern Blacks, who revived it. This [racist propaganda](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044109461814&seq=274&q1=deluded) sought to justify white terrorism as a means of self-defense.
  - **_Read More:_** [How Black Civil War Patriots Should Be Remembered This Veterans Day](https://time.com/7173749/black-patriots-freedom-civil-war/)
  - The myth about Appomattox thus became a key element of [Lost Cause orthodoxy](https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/lost-cause-the/), a form of propaganda that glorified slavery and the Confederacy and demonized Reconstruction. It merged with efforts by the white South to put Lee on a pedestal, both figuratively and literally. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scores of Southern cities and towns erected Confederate memorials, like Richmond’s towering Lee statue, that aimed to block from public view any story, memory, or perspective that did not accord with the Lost Cause orthodoxy.
  - The sanctification of Lee and other Confederate leaders, in turn, pushed the complexities of the surrender and of the Civil War era into the shadows, allowing the myth of Appomattox to flourish for more than a century.
  - The weaponization of this moment exposes the dangers of allowing myths to continue to stand in for history. The Confederate interpretation of Appomattox did lasting damage to Americans’ quest for national progress and unity: it exonerated insurrectionists, lionized them as martyrs, and helped return them to power. The essence of the Lost Cause was that the Civil War was not lost and could yet be won by new forms of racial proscription; for white supremacists, the Jim Crow era of disfranchisement, segregation, and one-party Democratic rule in the South was that promise vindicated.
  - ![](https://time.com/redesign/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.time.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F08%2FMBH-Sponsor-Box-V4.png&w=3840&q=75)
  - To peel back the layers of the Appomattox myth, and assess its damaging effects, is not to push a “baseless ideology” but instead to gain a clear-eyed, informed perspective on events that still reverberate in the present. A deeper, more nuanced account of Appomattox reveals that the war did not end neatly in April 1865 and that sectional animus was channeled into bitter partisan conflict. It helps Americans understand why Reconstruction failed and why [racial justice has proved so elusive](https://time.com/collection/visions-of-equity/).
  - Dispelling the myth reveals, too, counter-narratives to the dominant story, and the powerful lessons they might convey as Americans continue to grapple with the legacy of racism. Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, an acclaimed Black abolitionist who toured the South in 1867, offered a telling counterpoint to Grant’s hopes for repentance and Lee’s for restoration. After listening to the “heart-saddening stories of grievous old wrongs” endured by formerly enslaved Southerners, [she observed](https://archive.org/details/brightercomingda00harp/page/124/mode/2up?q=bravely) that the “shadows of the past” remained, but they bore “the promise of a brighter coming day. The work goes bravely on." For those in the postwar world determined to seize the promise of freedom, that was the true meaning of Appomattox.

  - April 3, 2025
  - Small tweaks to your daily routine can go a long way toward protecting your body’s control center and preventing cognitive decline down the road. In fact, scientists believe that as many as [45 percent of dementia cases](https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/dementia-prevention-intervention-care) could be delayed or prevented with help from some simple, sometimes surprising, changes in behavior.
  - It’s never too early or too late to start, but time is of the essence when it comes to building your brain’s defenses, especially since it’s generally impossible to reverse brain damage once it’s happened, said Dr. Eva Feldman, a professor of neurology at the University of Michigan’s Neuroscience Institute.
  - We asked eight neurologists and neuroscientists to share their best tips.
  -  1\. Wear a helmet.
  - Physically protecting your head is the single most important step you can take to safeguard your brain, experts said. Recurrent head trauma from traumatic brain injuries and concussions can lead to [chronic traumatic encephalopathy](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/20/sports/football/cte-study-concussions-brain-tackle.html) (C.T.E.), which can worsen cognition overall, and in some cases [cause dementia](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/well/mind/traumatic-brain-injuries-are-tied-to-dementia.html).
  - Wearing a helmet during activities like biking and skiing can significantly reduce the risk of injury, Dr. Feldman said. Motorcyclists should also always wear helmets, even if state laws don’t require them.
  -  2\. Put in earplugs when you’re mowing the lawn.
  - Older people with hearing loss have a greater risk for [developing dementia](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/well/mind/hearing-vision-dementia-risk.html). Scientists think it may be because the part of the brain that processes hearing is close to the part responsible for memory, or it could be a result of atrophy; people who have hearing loss tend to withdraw from social activities that could keep their minds engaged.
  - To protect your brain’s ability to process sensory signals, use earplugs or noise-protection earmuffs when you’re around loud sounds, said Dr. Elizabeth Bevins, a neurologist at UC San Diego Health. In addition, people over 50, and anyone frequently exposed to loud noises, should get a hearing test every one to three years, she said.
  - When it’s time to [get hearing aids](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/well/hearing-aids-over-the-counter.html), don’t hesitate. Even if you’re only losing hearing in one ear, the change can significantly impact your ability to interact with the world, said Dr. Shlee Song, a neurologist at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.
  - And don’t just put them in when you go out, Dr. Bevins added. Wear them when you’re alone, too, as it’s “important for the brain to receive auditory stimulation from even ambient noise.”
  -  3\. Get your eyes checked.
  - It’s not only about maintaining your hearing; scientists also believe vision loss is linked to cognitive decline. One [2023 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37440238/) found that about a third of adults over 71 who had moderate to severe vision impairment also had dementia. Scheduling regular eye exams (every few years in adulthood, depending on your [age and overall health](https://www.cdc.gov/vision-health/about-eye-disorders/why-eye-exams-are-important.html)) and [wearing glasses](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/15/well/live/eyesight-vision-habits.html) or getting corrective surgery, when needed, could help minimize that risk.
  - “We have this saying in brain health” that is especially true [for retirees](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/well/mind/retirement-brain-mental-health-tips.html), Dr. Song said: “Use it or lose it.” The brain is better at making connections, and processing input, for the senses that it actively uses, she said.
  -  4\. Take a walk, and swap your chair for a stool.
  - Neurologists know that [exercise benefits the brain](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/02/well/mind/exercise-mental-health-cognition.html) by [increasing blood flow](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30636734/) and ferrying oxygen to it. Even a small dose of daily exercise — like walking half a mile — can bring those rewards, said Dr. Cyrus Raji, an associate professor of radiology at Washington University School of Medicine.
  - Minimizing the amount of time you spend sitting or being inactive can also deliver some of those benefits, said Dr. Kevin Bickart, an assistant professor of behavioral and sports neurology at the University of California, Los Angeles. Standing up or walking around every 20 minutes or so can help; so can using a seat that forces you to engage your core. “Minimize fully supported seats,” Dr. Bickart said. “Use stools, boxes, benches or the floor when possible.”
  -  5\. Manage your cholesterol.
  - The low-density lipoprotein (or “bad”) [cholesterol](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/31/well/live/cholesterol-tests-levels-heart-disease.html) that can come from consuming red meats, full-fat dairy and sugary drinks can harden your arteries, restricting blood flow to the brain and increasing your risk for stroke and cognitive decline, said Dr. Fernando Testai, a professor of vascular neurology at the University of Illinois College of Medicine.
  - Eating [legumes](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/well/eat/chickpeas-health-benefits-recipes.html), whole grains and [fruits and vegetables](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/well/eat/avocados-health-benefits-recipes.html) can help you manage cholesterol levels. So can maintaining a healthy weight, regular aerobic exercise and medications like statins, Dr. Testai said. Check your levels every few years, or more frequently if you have diabetes or an elevated risk of stroke or heart disease, he said.
  -  6\. Floss every day.
  - Oral hygiene is essential for preventing infections and gum disease. Oral infections can spread to the sinuses, which can then trigger a clot or drainage problems in the brain, Dr. Song said. Research has also found a link between [gum disease and dementia](https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/large-study-links-gum-disease-dementia).
  - Regularly flossing and brushing your teeth and visiting the dentist at least every year (or twice a year) can keep your teeth and gums healthy, she said, which can help avert an infection that could lead to [future issues](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/well/oral-health-hygiene.html).
  -  7\. Join a book club.
  - Maintaining an active social life keeps the negative health effects of isolation — such as [depression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9938924/), or even [early mortality](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9836313/) — at bay, said Dr. Jessica Choi, a neurologist at Cedars-Sinai. Dr. Choi said that her patients who have a strong social support system are typically in better overall health than the ones who don’t. “Not having that can lead to depressive episodes,” which are tied to cognitive decline in older patients, she said. Book clubs or gardening groups can do the trick, but “even a scheduled monthly dinner with a close friend or family members makes a big difference for patients,” Dr. Choi said.
  -  8\. Wear a mask on smoggy or smoky days.
  - There’s [growing research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30775976/) linking air pollution exposure to cognitive decline; scientists think very fine, inhalable particles in the air could trigger chemical changes once they reach the brain, said Deborah Cory-Slechta, a neuroscientist in the department of environmental medicine at University of Rochester Medical Center. Not all harmful particles can be avoided — some are so small that they slip through air filters — but wearing an N95 or surgical mask and using indoor air filters on days when air quality is worse (including because of wildfire smoke) can minimize your exposure, she said.
  -  9\. Watch your neck.
  - Your neck supplies blood to your brain, and neck injuries can restrict that blood flow, starving the brain of oxygen, or even causing clots. Dr. Song said she often sees patients with neck twists from car accidents, bad massages or [chiropractic visits](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/15/well/live/neck-manipulation-chiropractor.html).
  - To protect your neck from injury, “avoid any sudden twist or pulling adjustments,” she said. “I’d avoid massage guns or ‘deep tissue’ massage when it comes to the neck. Stick with the upper back and shoulders.” Wearing a seatbelt in the car is also crucial. Visit a doctor promptly if you suspect you have a neck injury, she said.
  -  10\. Sleep well.
  - Finding ways to [improve your time](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/07/well/live/sleep-better-age.html) spent sleeping, and the quality of that sleep, can go a long way toward helping you stay sharp and [fend off dementia](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/well/mind/sleep-dementia.html), Dr. Feldman said.
  - If you work night shifts and sleep during the day, consider blackout shades to help regulate your body’s circadian rhythm, she said. If anxiety and depression are keeping you up, try meditating before bed, she added. If you aren’t sure where your sleep problems lie, keep a sleep diary to help identify potential issues.
  - “A rested mind” is crucial for brain health, “as sleep helps consolidate memories and [clear out cellular debris](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07108-6) from the brain,” Dr. Feldman said.

  -  The Rule of 1,000 Hours in Retirement | Kiplinger
  - >  Excerpt
  - > For retirees, the rule of 1,000 hours brings intention and clarity to your day. Because time is the most valuable thing you can spend.
  - ---
  - The real national pastime isn’t baseball. If you go by how Americans actually spend their leisure time, it’s something even slower: watching TV.
  - According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ [<u>American Time Use Survey</u>](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/atus_06272024.htm), Americans spend nearly three hours a day watching television, making it the country’s most popular leisure activity. Among retirees, that number rises to more than four hours a day.
  - “Unfortunately, many people think they’re going to be someone different in retirement, but they’re not. In fact, it’s you times two,” says [<u>Robert Laura</u>](https://robertlaura.com/), founder of the Retirement Coaches Association.

  - ![Kiplinger Retirement Planning Guide 2025](https://g314.kiplinger.com/rest/v2/dialogues/files/bfe97b1d-c556-48a0-8827-a6fad84dc00a/Kiplinger_Retirement_Planning_Guide_2025.png)
  - That’s because even after leaving work, many retirees fall into familiar routines, convinced they’ll have more time later. This is a common psychological bias known as [<u>future time slack</u>](https://www.sciencealert.com/there-s-a-scientific-reason-you-always-overcommit-to-future-plans).
  - But free time in retirement isn’t unlimited. Look closely at how retirees spend their time, and it adds up to roughly 1,000 hours a year of meaningful, discretionary time.
  - When it comes to [<u>building a fulfilling retirement</u>](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/happy-retirement/habits-for-a-happy-retirement), research and experts say that how you spend your time can be just as important as how you spend your money. And for the four million Americans reaching [<u>retirement age</u>](https://www.protectedincome.org/peak65/) each year, the clock is already ticking.
  - The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) tracks how Americans spend their hours each day. It shows that the average adult enjoys about five hours of leisure time per day, or around 1,800 hours a year.
  - But not all of that time is high-quality. A closer look shows that the largest share is spent on passive activities like watching TV, scrolling online and casual socializing. When you account for how much leisure time is absorbed by low-effort habits, the truly discretionary, meaningful time — the kind you can intentionally spend on hobbies, passions, travel, [<u>volunteering</u>](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/retire-early-for-adventure-travel-and-volunteer) or learning new skills — shrinks to about 1,000 hours a year.
  - And that’s just an estimate. Unexpected obligations, [caregiving needs](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/long-term-care/family-caregivers-need-help-policies-they-say-would-make-a-difference) or health issues can chip away at it even further. That’s why the “rule of 1,000 hours” offers a more realistic framework: It’s the amount of time retirees can reasonably expect to control and use with purpose each year.
  - Arguably, that time may be more valuable than money. As the authors of one [<u>academic paper</u>](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9916207/) put it, “Time is a precious commodity in later life, made even more so by challenging post-retirement circumstances.”
  -  When free time becomes a challenge
  - Many people underestimate the hidden losses that come with leaving work.
  - “You lose more than you gain in retirement,” says Laura.
  - While retirees gain time, they can also lose routine, structure, [<u>social connection</u>](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/the-cost-of-loneliness-in-retirement), mental stimulation and a sense of purpose. As Laura notes, “Golfing, fishing or watching the grandkids doesn’t replace all of those things.” In fact, his [<u>research</u>](https://retirementcoachesassociation.org/research) shows that 76% of retirees have seen someone struggle with the transition, and 51% say it takes longer than a year to adjust.
  - This helps explain why millions of retirees return to work after stepping away. According to [<u>T. Rowe Price</u>](https://www.troweprice.com/personal-investing/resources/insights/unretiring-why-recent-retirees-want-to-go-back-to-work.html), about half (48%) of retirees who work say they need to for financial reasons, while a similar share (45%) chose to work for social and emotional benefits.
  - Psychologists have also found that too much unstructured free time can actually lower well-being. A study published by the [<u>American Psychological Association</u>](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2021/09/too-much-free-time) reported that while well-being rises with more free time, it peaks around two hours per day and begins to decline when people have more than five discretionary hours daily.
  - However, other retirees encounter the opposite problem, Laura adds. “Some retirees say they’re busier than ever, but the tasks are meaningless. Over time, that leaves them feeling used rather than helpful.”
  - Awareness is the first step. The next is creating a plan for how you’ll spend your time in retirement, just as carefully as you planned for your finances.

  - 0 seconds of 4 minutes, 5 secondsVolume 0%
  -  Making the most of your 1,000 hours
  - Financial experts agree that a retirement plan works best when it’s built around more than just numbers.
  - “When you stop working, you lose not just a paycheck but also a built-in schedule. That structure has to be replaced with something meaningful,” says Melissa Caro, CFP® and founder of [<u>My Retirement Network</u>](https://myretirementnetwork.com/).
  - She works with clients to brainstorm how they want to spend their days. “Once they map out an ideal week or month, we can align the financial plan around it. When time, money and purpose are in sync, that’s when retirement feels truly fulfilling.”
  - Research backs this up. A 2022 study published in [<u><em>Acta Psychologica</em></u>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691822003109) found that retirees who proactively prepare for life after work report more engagement in [<u>leisure activities</u>](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/want-to-retire-happily-plan-for-leisure-and-purpose), higher well-being and lower levels of stress.
  - Not all activities deliver the same benefits. A 2020 study identifies three clusters — physical, intellectual and social activities — that are linked to [<u>better mental and physical health</u>](https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article-abstract/75/9/1873/5488082) outcomes later in life. Staying active, learning new skills and maintaining strong social connections can help retirees thrive far beyond just filling time.
  - That requires being intentional with how you use your time, says Jan Valecka, CFP® and principal of [<u>Valecka Wealth Management</u>](https://www.vwmplanning.com/), who advises clients to dream five to 10 years ahead and budget for experiences like travel. “If they have the money set aside, they’re more likely to take the trip and not feel guilty about spending it. We spend a lot of time encouraging clients who have done a good job saving to [enjoy their money](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/retirement-planning/are-you-a-retirement-millionaire-too-scared-to-spend), because either they’ll go first class — or their kids will.”
  - Laura also recommends writing down what the perfect retirement schedule looks like. “It helps people realize how much time they need to fill — and how quickly retirement can start to feel like a _Groundhog Day_ scenario if they don’t plan.”
  - It’s a fitting reference. In the 1993 film, Bill Murray’s character famously asks: “What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same and nothing that you did mattered?”
  - Perhaps that desire to avoid reliving the same life over and over is why two-thirds (66%) of today’s retirees say they [<u>prefer trying new things in their leisure time</u>](https://agewave.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-Leisure-in-Retirement_Beyond-the-Bucket-List.pdf) versus doing things they’ve already experienced.
  - Workers [<u>most often associate retirement</u>](https://www.transamericainstitute.org/docs/default-source/research/post-pandemic-retirement-realities-multigenerational-workforce-report-july-2023.pdf) with the word “freedom.” How you spend those 1,000 hours is ultimately up to you. If a movie marathon on TV happens to be your activity of choice, you might catch _The Lord of the Rings_ airing during the holidays. And maybe, amid the adventure, you’ll hear the wizard Gandalf’s wise reminder:
  - “All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.”

  -  Why Gen-X And Gen-Z Saw Right Through Zuckerberg's Social Experiment — But Millennials Fell For It | YourTango
  - >  Excerpt
  - > Writer Victoria Muggridge breaks down why Mark Zuckerberg's social experiment failed with the generations raised with the instinct to reject what he was selling and why one particular generation — the Millennials — got sucked right in.
  - ---
  -  What happens when a tech millionaire spends two decades trying to control how we behave online? For Millennials — it mostly worked. For Gen-X and Gen-Z? Not so much.
  - They see the game. They’re not playing. Here’s why Zuckerberg‘s ultimate social experiment fails with the two generations that refuse to be manipulated.
  - Whenever I see a picture of Zuckerberg online, I get this weird, eerie feeling — like he’s trying hard to act human but hasn’t quite nailed it. I’m not saying he’s an alien. But if you told me he was a bot sent back from the future to [make us dependent on digital dopamine hits](https://www.yourtango.com/self/addicition-turning-you-into-total-narcissist), I wouldn’t argue.
  - Maybe it’s the way he doesn’t blink. Maybe it’s the way he drinks water like he just learned how. Or maybe it’s the fact that he’s spent two decades running the world’s biggest social experiment with a straight face.
  - I’ve grown up with this guy plastered everywhere. I’ve watched him spend the better part of two decades trying to pull off the ultimate social experiment: Turning the internet into [a giant dopamine casino](https://www.yourtango.com/self/woman-explains-get-dopamine-hit-shopping-without-spending) where everyone willingly feeds their data into the machine.
  - I’ve done it, too. Without batting an eye. He’s had plenty of success with Millennials. [They devoured Facebook](https://www.yourtango.com/self/happy-photos-facebook-dont-mean-happy-life) in its prime, branded themselves on Instagram, and tried (painfully) to make the Metaverse happen. But he will never, ever fully capture Gen-X or Gen-Z.
  - Why? Because despite their differences, both generations have an instinctive distrust of authority. Manipulation hits these two like a fart in a lift. So, it’s inevitable they have a deep resistance to giving Zuckerberg exactly what he wants.
  -  Gen-X and Gen-Z don’t trust institutions, especially not tech giants like Facebook.
  - 
  - Gen-X was raised to be skeptical of everything: Big business, governments, and any authority figure trying to tell them what to do. They saw greed up close and lived through economic crashes. They learned fast. _Trust the system, and you’ll get burned._
  - Gen-Z, meanwhile, [grew up in the rubble of all that](https://www.yourtango.com/self/harsh-realities-growing-up-gen-z-still-figuring-out). They never saw corporations as benevolent forces. Just exploitative machines designed to extract as much from them as possible.
  - **RELATED: [11 Values Boomers Think Are Important That Mean Nothing To Young People Today](https://www.yourtango.com/self/values-boomers-think-are-important-mean-nothing-young-people-today)**
  - Gen-Z won’t be caught dead on Facebook. Unless they want to message their parents. The fake-feels of Instagram? That’s for wannabe influencers clinging to relevance. And Meta? They know a desperate cash grab when they see one.
  - They know these platforms aren’t here for their well-being. They exist to sell data, keep users addicted, and push whatever content generates the most revenue. Gen-X learned to distrust corporations. Gen-Z never trusted them to begin with.
  -  Gen-X and Gen-Z know when they’re being manipulated.
  - Zuckerberg’s entire empire is built on a simple premise: keep people engaged long enough to monetize them. Millennials, who grew up in the explosive rise of social media, swallowed the dream whole. They latched onto the “sharing economy” because it dangled promises of connection, community, and self-branding.
  - Gen-X and Gen-Z? They didn’t take the bait.
  - [Gen-X spent their youth](https://www.yourtango.com/self/common-gen-x-childhood-experiences-parents-today-dont-think-are-normal-all) drowning in infomercials and glossy magazine spreads. All trying (and failing) to shove unnecessary junk down their throats. They learned early to side-eye authority. That applied to politicians, corporations, and their own parents.
  - **RELATED: [11 Ways Boomers And Gen X Inaccurately Judge Gen Z’s Work Ethic](https://www.yourtango.com/career/ways-boomers-and-gen-x-inaccurately-judge-gen-zs-work-ethic)**
  - Gen-Z, meanwhile, was born into the most aggressive marketing war zone in history. From the moment they could hold an iPad, they were ambushed by hyper-personalized ads. Let’s not even talk about algorithm-driven rabbit holes and endless dopamine traps.
  - But instead of rolling over, they fought back. Ad blockers, burner accounts, and digital detoxes aren’t rebellion for Gen-Z. They’re survival tactics. Gen-X ignores corporate nonsense. Gen-Z sabotages it.
  -  Meta’s Metaverse? No, thanks.
  - Zuckerberg’s biggest mistake? Thinking every generation would chase social media like Millennials chasing clout. Then came the Metaverse. An expensive, overhyped fever dream that was supposed to change the way people lived, worked, and breathed online.
  - Gen-X took one look and said, “Nope. Already lived through Second Life. That was enough.” They were there for the internet’s Wild West — MySpace and the first social media boom. They never bought in the way Millennials did. And they sure as heck weren’t about to strap on a VR headset just because Zuckerberg told them to.
  - Gen-Z, however, runs the digital world. But on their terms. They [don’t want to be trapped in a corporate-controlled sandbox](https://www.yourtango.com/self/rather-be-happy-than-slaving-away-soul-sucking-job), where every interaction is tracked. They’d rather hang out on Discord, make niche TikToks, and game in ecosystems they control. Gen-X has been there, and done that. Gen-Z just doesn’t care.
  - **RELATED: [11 Ways Gen Z Is Quietly Reshaping Society Without Boomers Noticing](https://www.yourtango.com/self/ways-gen-z-quietly-reshaping-society-without-boomers-noticing)**
  -  The more Zuckerberg tries, the more he fails.
  - 
  - If there’s one thing Gen-X and Gen-Z can’t stand, it’s being forced into something. The moment a social platform feels like a chore, a “new” 9–5, or an obvious attempt at manipulation, they check out.
  - Gen-X left Facebook the second it became a virtual retirement home for unhinged political rants. Gen-Z only visits when they need to send a “K” text to their parents.
  - Gen-X still uses Instagram, but only because they haven’t found a better time-killer. Gen-Z treats Instagram like a Millennial at Coachella — trying way too hard to be relevant.
  - Instead, they keep moving to whatever new platform feels authentic. Every time Zuckerberg pivots, rebrands, or tries to force engagement, both generations give a collective “meh” and go do something else.
  - If it feels forced, it’s already dead.
  -  You can’t control people built to resist control.
  - The reason Zuckerberg will never successfully capture Gen-X or Gen-Z is simple. These generations were shaped by different worlds. Both were raised with an instinctive rejection of precisely what he’s trying to sell.
  - Gen-X doesn’t care enough about social media to bother. Gen-Z cares too much about protecting themselves to play along.
  - So, while Millennials are still trying to decode whatever sorcery is happening with the algorithm this week, Gen-X is off-grid in the woods with no signal. And Gen-Z is making TikToks about how social media is dead — on social media.
  - Zuck can keep tweaking his algorithms and selling the dream of an immersive digital utopia, but Gen-X won’t see the notification, and Gen-Z will just make a meme out of it.

Mr. Harris is a senior fellow at the New America Foundation and the author of “The State Must Provide: Why America’s Colleges Have Always Been Unequal — And How to Set Them Right.”

Last week, the Trump administration threatened to [withhold](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/public-school-funding-trump-dei.html) funding specifically from schools and school districts with high shares of low-income students if they did not verify in 10 days the elimination of certain diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights at the department, declared in a release announcing the memo, “Federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right.”

This is not the first time that the Department of Education has outlined the Trump administration’s interpretation of civil rights law. States are already required to certify that they will comply with federal antidiscrimination laws — as New York officials noted [when they refused](https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2025/04/04/new-york-state-education-department-wont-certify-trump-administration-anti-dei-policy/) to comply with the administration’s demands.

What makes the latest guidance from the department so pernicious is that it specifically targets Title I funding, which goes to schools that tend to have higher percentages of students of color.

The willingness of the administration to target schools serving low-income students for noncompliance with its interpretation of federal civil rights law illustrates its commitment to returning American education to a time before the Civil Rights Act, when the nation’s most vulnerable students were largely unprotected.

**Since the inauguration**, the Trump administration has laid off more than 1,300 employees at the Department of Education (hundreds more have taken buyouts) with the ultimate goal of eliminating the department altogether. Through its programs and enforcement actions over the last four and a half decades, the Department of Education has been the chief entity ensuring that in every state students who are racial minorities, those with disabilities, English language-learners and members of other marginalized communities, are not discriminated against and have access to the same [quality education](https://ia801506.us.archive.org/25/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.89917/2015.89917.Higher-Education-For-American-Democracy-A-Report-Of-The-Presidents-Commission-On-Higher-Education-Vol-I---Vi_text.pdf) that [has historically](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/12/reconstruction-education-black-students-public-schools/675816/) been [provided](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2000/dec/phc-t-41.html) to wealthy, white students.

The Department of Education was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter who, while governor of Georgia (as well as a county school board member), made it a priority to improve the state’s education system. Education guaranteed full citizenship, and when he declared in his inaugural address that “no poor, rural, weak or Black person” should be deprived of one — several conservative state senators walked out. In four years, Georgia made significant strides in early childhood education and integration.

Mr. Carter’s successes were perhaps more impressive given that his predecessor was a staunch segregationist. There were still education issues to be resolved in Georgia as elsewhere in the nation, and Mr. Carter wanted to do more, but he was term-limited. Leaving office, he knew that as quickly as rights were won and gains were made, they could all go away.

Mr. Carter took that knowledge on the national campaign trail. “It is time for the law to be enforced. We cannot educate children, we cannot create harmony among our people, we cannot preserve basic human freedom unless we have an orderly society,” he said when accepting the Democratic nomination for president in 1976.

When he arrived in Washington, there were more than 260 education-related programs spread across various federal agencies; creating a separate department — one that wrapped program administration and rights enforcement together — would streamline bureaucracy. The department would support states in addressing the deep educational inequities they faced, and it would be a backstop if states failed in that mission.

During her confirmation hearing, Education Secretary Linda McMahon argued that her administration’s policies to return education to the states would prevent the nation’s schools from being “corrupted by political ideologies, special interests and unjust discrimination.” But rather than removing corrupting political ideology by selectively limiting the federal influence in education, the Trump administration has inserted it — paving the way to re-establish a system rife with unjust discrimination.

**When President Trump** first entered office, in 2017, conservatives argued that — from K-12 to higher education — schools taught students [what to think](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/02/23/devos-colleges-tell-students-what-to-do-what-to-say-and-more-ominously-what-to-think/) rather than how to think_._ As Ms. McMahon [put it](https://edsource.org/2025/trumps-nominee-says-she-may-break-apart-not-shut-down-education-department/726861) recently, parents and grandparents “worry that their children and grandchildren are no longer taught American values and true history.” The culture had veered too far left, critics of education argued; the path to making America great again ran through the schools, specifically by ridding them of a leftist ideological agenda they claimed was part and parcel of the curriculum. On the right, focus on the performance of America’s schools and students has come to be largely supplanted by near-hysterical concern about the nature of what students are being taught.

By 2020, this complaint had grown into a movement. Ideologues like Chris Rufo began invoking and [contorting academic phrases](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/05/gops-critical-race-theory-fixation-explained/618828/) like critical race theory and business strategies like diversity, equity and inclusion into a catchall scapegoat for complaints about the ways America had changed. Diversity had superseded merit as American society’s chief goal, [they](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/27/opinion/christopher-rufo-diversity-desantis-florida-university.html) argued. Across the country, activists began criticizing [books](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/10/05/website-driving-banned-books-surge-moms-for-liberty/70922213007/) they did not like and [curriculums](https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/02/06/moms-for-liberty-curriculum-battle/) in elementary and secondary school. And conservatives distorted the [language](https://www.al.com/education/2023/09/feds-look-into-claim-of-reverse-discrimination-in-an-alabama-colleges-scholarships.html) of civil rights to suggest that efforts to make higher education institutions more inclusive or to provide opportunities for those who have been historically barred from them were [themselves discriminatory](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/us/affirmative-action-lawsuit.html).

Diversity efforts in education — from [college diversity](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/education/2024/01/17/sb-17-texas-ut-austin-multicultural-engagement-center-closes-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/72176458007/) programming to nonsanitized versions of American history — grew out of the civil rights movement and attempts to ensure that founders’ promises were available to all Americans. Our education system has never been perfect, but the view espoused by many in the modern conservative movement is that [programs](https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/404120/richard-hanania-dei-policy-trump) that have led to significant progress — progress the Department of Education has helped guarantee through its Office for Civil Rights and the programs it administers such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or Title I — have been in error. Max Eden, a former fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, has argued that the “the antidiscrimination provisions of the Civil Rights Act do not apply to white students or teachers.” But in reality, for much of American history, white students were the only ones who had their rights considered at all.

**Education is not** **[explicitly](https://law.vanderbilt.edu/a-novel-argument-for-the-right-to-public-education/)** protected in the Constitution, outside of the implicit promise of the 14th Amendment that no state can “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” But public education rights have always been central to how America’s leaders have thought about the nation’s growth. Even the founders considered for whom and what formal schooling should be designed.

George Washington argued that education should be lawmakers’ chief concern in his first annual address before Congress in 1790, saying, “Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness.” Alongside his contemporaries such as James Madison and Benjamin Rush, Washington believed that education was the best way to build good citizens.

But the founders also knew how important an education was to citizenship because by the time the first signature stained the Declaration of Independence, slave codes in many parts of the colonies had barred enslaved Black people from learning to read. After Gabriel’s Rebellion, a planned slave revolt in 1800, slaveholders across the South barred Black people from reading the Bible as they were wary that it would give the enslaved ideas of liberation. Educating women was an afterthought for almost everyone except Rush. Denying people education meant denying them citizenship. Washington’s idea of civic education was exclusionary by default; it accounted for the experiences of only wealthy, white men.

At nearly every moment when America could have expanded educational opportunity, the nation chose inequality. The 1862 Morrill Act doled out millions of acres of land that states could sell to fund colleges that Black students were almost exclusively barred from attending; discrimination prevented Black veterans from enjoying the spoils of the G.I. Bill which Congress passed to provide World War II veterans money for college, housing and unemployment insurance. At the same time, in America’s public schools, students were being taught an incomplete, revisionist history.

As the long civil rights movement began to bear fruit — through court wins like that in Brown v. Board of Education, and in higher education cases that preceded it, like [Sipuel v. Board of Regents](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep332/usrep332631/usrep332631.pdf) — the nation began including everyone’s accomplishments in its story. In 1961, California [passed a law](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED038466.pdf) forbidding the adoption of textbooks with materials that did “not correctly portray the role and contribution of the American Negro and members of other ethnic groups in the total development of the United States.” That necessarily meant explaining the trials those people had been through. Several states — Oklahoma, New Jersey, Illinois, Nebraska — followed suit. At the same time, colleges and universities — in efforts to recruit students whose entry had historically been barred — began race-conscious admissions programs.

The national reconsideration of how the American story was told in history and popular culture, whose achievements were included in that telling, and strategies to account for all of the years of inequality, were attacked immediately. Some white Americans viewed policies intended to help address a legacy of discrimination against others as a discrimination against themselves, which led to lawsuits. Cases like Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which fought the affirmative action strategy at the university’s Davis School of Medicine, sought to dismantle the apparatus that would enforce the Civil Rights Act. As soon as rights were won, they were disputed.

By the end of President Trump’s first term in office, he assumed that fight — beginning an assault on a bastardized version of [critical race theory](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/05/gops-critical-race-theory-fixation-explained/618828/) not long after Mr. Rufo blasted it on Fox News — and sought to blunt the momentum around books, articles and reports that examined the full breadth of American history, such as the 1619 Project_._

**America’s story is** one of progress, which has rarely been obtained simply through good will. It has to be enforced. Fights for equality have been messy, and quite bloody at times. Understanding that history is important so as not to repeat it. Still, shortly before leaving office in 2020, Mr. Trump established the President’s Advisory 1776 Commission, in part a rebuttal to the 1619 Project, as a way for the administration to write its own version of American history.

On Jan. 18, 2021, when Mr. Trump’s panel released its report, it put forth a view of American history that has relentlessly bent toward progress through slavery and Jim Crow. That trend began to reverse, the panel argued, at the culmination of the civil rights movement. “The civil rights movement was almost immediately turned to programs that ran counter to the lofty ideals of the founders,” the authors of the report wrote. They argued that the idea that “past discrimination requires present effort” — the logic of affirmative action — amounted to reverse discrimination. “Those forms of preferential treatment built up in our system over time, first in administrative rulings, then executive orders, later in congressionally passed law, and finally were sanctified by the Supreme Court.”

That is now a view held by officials in the current Trump administration. For example, a 2021 review of Christopher Caldwell’s book “The Age of Entitlement,” by Craig Trainor, endorses the idea [that the](https://quillette.com/2021/09/17/george-floyd-political-violence-and-the-rise-of-the-rival-constitution/) government which grew up to enforce the Civil Rights Act went too far.

“Contrary to the contemporary platitude, it is not diversity that is our strength, but the American Creed animated by the Declaration’s equality principle and the Constitution’s guarantee thereof,” Mr. Trainor wrote. But America [did not embrace](https://x.com/AdamHSays/status/1579863985599680513) the colorblind principle until its inequalities were already baked in.

In some ways, Mr. Trump’s 1776 commissioners and conservatives who align with that view are right: Civil rights programs that seek to include people the founders never would have considered Americans — much less citizens deserving of rights — might run counter to their ideals. But to suggest that programs created immediately after the end of Jim Crow to ameliorate its impacts amount to reverse discrimination in the present day is wrongheaded.

After Mr. Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 election, Florida, Texas and North Carolina took on the battle to reclaim the sanitized version of American history that existed before the 1960s. Republican state lawmakers have prohibited discussion of L.G.B.T.Q. identities in the classroom, banned diversity initiatives and scholarship programs, eroded tenure protections for faculty and appointed ideologically driven members to board positions at colleges. And they have tied their efforts to redesign general education curriculums to the funding they provide colleges.

The state legislative changes to curriculums and policy were made worse by the [Supreme Court’s decision](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/11/us/harvard-affirmative-action-diversity-admissions.html) in June 2023 to eliminate the use of race in college admissions. Since then, in cases where there have not been sufficient declines in Black enrollment, affirmative action’s opponents have argued that institutions [must](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/affirmative-action-california.html) be flouting the law.

The Trump administration has taken the fight back to the federal level. They have fired hundreds of members of the Education Department’s office for civil rights, effectively turning the office’s investigations into a pretense for punishing dissent under the guise of combating antisemitism; they have sought to erase tens of millions of dollars in university funding before investigations are completed; and they have tried to bludgeon universities into submission — all while eliminating vital roles at the Education Department that actually sought to help students and protect their rights.

The president’s vision to take a sledgehammer to the Department of Education’s ability to function will cause student suffering. The founders believed that education was critical to the full experience of citizenship; it was where students learned arts, sciences, humanities and how to engage with one another. But putting that vision into place left the nation with a system where inequities — in content and classroom composition — were left in place.

America began to undo those inequities, and the department protected that progress. Now, less than three months into Mr. Trump’s second presidency, the administration has done everything in its power, and some things beyond its authority, to ensure we are equal no more.

    - **Want to stay updated on what’s happening in Israel?** , and we’ll send our latest coverage to your inbox.
    - There was a time when a meeting between the president of the United States and the prime minister of Israel brought only pride to both Israeli and American Jews, who saw two democratic leaders working together. Well, I know that I am not alone when I say that pride is not the emotion that welled up in me on seeing the [chummy picture](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/us/politics/netanyahu-trump-israel-gaza.html) of Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu meeting in the Oval Office on Monday. It was disgust and depression.
    - Each is a wannabe autocrat, each is working to undermine the rule of law and so-called elites in his respective country, each is seeking to crush what he calls a “deep state” of government professionals. Each is steering his nation away from its once universal aspiration to be a “light unto the nations” toward a narrow, brutish might-equals-right ethnonationalism that is ready to mainstream ethnic cleansing. Each treats his political opposition not as legitimate but as enemies within, and each has filled his cabinet with incompetent hacks, deliberately chosen for loyalty to him instead of the laws of their lands.
    - Each is driving his country away from its democratic traditional allies. Each asserts territorial expansion as a divine right — “From the Gulf of America to Greenland” and “From the West Bank to Gaza.”
    - In 2008, Fareed Zakaria published a prescient book titled “The Post-American World.” He argued that while the United States would continue to be the dominant world power, the “rise of the rest” — nations like China and India — meant that America’s relative dominance would shrink as the Cold War era receded.
    - Trump and Netanyahu are engaged, each in his own country, in creating a “post-America” and a “post-Israel” world. By “post-America,” though, I don’t mean an America that is losing relative power but an America that is deliberately shedding its core identity as a country, on its best days, committed to the rule of law at home and the betterment of all humanity abroad. By “post-Israel,” I mean an Israel that is deliberately shedding its core identity — that of a proudly proclaimed rule-of-law democracy in a region of strongmen that will always prioritize a permanent peace with Palestinians (if its security can be assured) over “a permanent piece’’ of the West Bank and Gaza.

    - Instead, Trump and Vance want to transform our nation into a post-Reagan America, an America that treats democratic, free market, rule-of-law allies like the European Union with disdain. Trump recently stated that the European Union was created to “[screw the U.S.](https://www.reuters.com/video/watch/idRW478727022025RP1/)” — a sentiment he repeated sitting next to Netanyahu in the Oval Office. The sheer malevolence and historical ignorance of that statement takes your breath away.
    - Trump and Vance also want to take us to a post-America that greets courageous defenders of freedom’s frontier — namely Ukraine — with demands for their mineral rights in return for grudging military assistance.
    - Finally, they want to take us to a post-America that is not the least bit interested in preserving, let alone enhancing, its soft power — the power to enlist allies and attract talented immigrants — a concept [popularized by](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/politics/trump-tariffs-migrants-power.html) the Harvard political scientist Joseph S. Nye Jr. They have contempt for soft power, being utterly ignorant of the fact that if we lose it, we lose our ability to get other nations to join with us to shape a world more receptive to our interests and values, the single greatest advantage we always had over Russia and China.
    - In mindlessly shrinking our own government and dissing so many of our traditional allies, “Trump is not just destroying careers and values, he is quite literally making America weak again,” the Stanford democracy expert Larry Diamond told me. That is about as “post” the America I grew up in — and aspire to see my grandchildren grow up in — as I can imagine.
    - Netanyahu has been hard at work creating a similar post-Israel. Trump forced out his F.B.I. director for being insufficiently loyal; Netanyahu [is close to doing the same](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-supreme-court-consider-intelligence-chief-dismissal-2025-04-07/) with Ronen Bar, the widely respected head of Israel’s F.B.I. equivalent, the Shin Bet, at a time when Bar is investigating some of Netanyahu’s top aides over alleged ties to the Qatari government.
    - Netanyahu himself is on trial on corruption charges. He stands accused by the Israeli opposition — [and by more than a few relatives of hostages](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/04/middleeast/netanyahu-derailed-hostage-deal-in-july-intl/index.html) — of prolonging the Gaza war to appease the Jewish supremacists who keep him in power and potentially out of jail. That prolongation also [forestalls any commission of inquiry](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-03-07/ty-article/.premium/evasion-cynicism-and-panic-netanyahus-campaign-against-a-state-commission-of-inquiry/00000195-6d20-d8af-a39f-7ff13ff90000) for the disastrous war, which started on his watch and for reasons directly traceable to his policy failure: his belief that Hamas could be bought off with bags of [money from Qatar.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-qatar-money-prop-up-hamas.html)
    - He is also trying, as we speak, [to remove](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/world/middleeast/israel-attorney-general.html) Israel’s independent and courageous attorney general because he apparently considers her disloyal. Since coming to office in late 2022, Netanyahu has also been on a mission to undermine the power of the Israeli Supreme Court to check the decisions of the executive and legislative branches. This is related to his party’s religious-nationalist agenda to annex the West Bank and Gaza and evict as many Palestinians as possible — a goal feasible only if that court’s power to restrain the prime minister and his Jewish supremacist coalition is broken.

    - The public and the opposition get so overwhelmed they find it hard “to process the deluge,” he added, and resistance slowly fragments. Sound familiar?
    - Trump’s and Netanyahu’s domestic strategies have truly merged with the weaponization of antisemitism as a way to silence or [delegitimize](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1604595303230889991?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1604595303230889991%7Ctwgr%5E9db69e9380acf35cb3b9b0939983ee548567e5ea%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.timesofisrael.com%2Fnetanyahu-accuses-ny-times-of-demonizing-israel-for-decades%2F) critics. Readers of this column know that I have zero respect for any campus protesters who bash Israeli actions in Gaza without uttering a word of censure for Hamas — let alone a word of support for Ukrainians whose democracy is being savaged by Vladimir Putin’s Russia. But ours is, for now, still a free country, and if people aren’t engaging in violent acts, or harassing other students in or out of class, they should be free to say whatever they want, including advocating a Palestinian state of whatever size they want.
    - “President Trump has taken a real phenomenon that needs to be addressed — antisemitism that emerges out of debates on Israel — and is using it to justify crackdowns on immigration, higher education and free speech on Israel,” Jonathan Jacoby, national director of the [Nexus Project](https://nexusproject.us/nexus-resources/fighting-antisemitism-protecting-democracy-a-strategy-for-the-trump-era/), which works to fight antisemitism and uphold democracy[,](https://nexusproject.us/nexus-resources/fighting-antisemitism-protecting-democracy-a-strategy-for-the-trump-era/) said to me.
    - As an American Jew, I neither need nor want Trump’s cynical defense. He is still the man who, in 2017, defended the white nationalists and neo-Nazis who protested in Charlottesville, Va., [as including](https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/116973/documents/HHRG-118-ED00-20240417-SD006.pdf) “some very fine people.” Vance has also [embraced](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/14/us/politics/vance-far-right-germany-munich-afd.html) Germany’s [Nazi-sympathizing, Holocaust-trivializing](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/alternative-germany-afd-party-what-you-need-know) AfD party, whose leaders have called on Germans to stop atoning for Nazi crimes.
    - Netanyahu — like Trump and thanks to Trump — feels a sense of impunity, a sense that nothing can take him down. That kind of thinking filters down and is what leads to incidents like the one last month in which Israeli forces [killed 15 paramedics and rescue workers](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-aid-workers-deaths-video.html) in southern Gaza, an incident that “[the chain of command below simply lied](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-04-08/ty-article/.premium/trump-gives-netanyahu-free-hand-on-gaza-and-iran-but-is-he-using-israel/00000196-11e5-d294-ad97-bbe76b480000)” about, a senior Israel Defense Forces officer told Haaretz.
    - Fortunately, Israeli civil society has shown a lot of fight — much more than America’s so far — and no wonder. Because while Trump can denounce America’s elites to the cheers of his base, Israelis know their country cannot survive without its technical, scientific and military elites. Which is why this month, 18 former Israeli security chiefs — of the I.D.F., Mossad, Shin Bet, military intelligence and police — declared that Netanyahu was unfit to serve as prime minister, because his “conduct poses a clear and immediate danger to Israel’s security and future as a Jewish democratic state.”
    - To all who aspire to prevent a post-America, post-Israel world, I have only one message: This is the fight of our lives. I am all in — and I am not tired. How about you?

  - Even by the ugly standards of this administration, the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia stands out.
  - A Salvadoran migrant and metal worker in Maryland with no criminal record other than traffic violations and illegal entry into the country, he was arrested by immigration authorities in March and deported to one of the [notorious prisons](https://x.com/nayibbukele/status/1901245427216978290) of his homeland, in contravention of a U.S. immigration judge’s order. The government acknowledged the “administrative error” — an Orwellian euphemism for a Kafkaesque nightmare — but petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a federal judge’s order requiring his return on Monday. The same day, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the lower court’s order so it can have time to consider the case.
  - Abrego Garcia was an unimportant person when he was deported — except, of course, to his wife and son and two stepchildren. He is the subject of an accusation that he belonged to the MS-13 gang — but there is only flimsy evidence and no proof. The entire edifice of American justice is built on the conviction that there is no guilt without proof beyond reasonable doubt — and that there is no unimportant person, at least not in the eyes of the law.
  - I’ve been thinking about this case as an emblem of everything that makes Donald Trump’s presidency so vile and destructive, even when I’ve [bent](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/21/opinion/bret-stephens-trump-voters.html) [over](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/opinion/columnists/donald-trump-election.html) [backward](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/opinion/never-trump-republicans.html) to give him the benefit of the doubt, and even when I’ve agreed with him on this or that [point](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/opinion/dei-military-social-justice.html) [of](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/opinion/trump-hamas-gaza-israel.html) [policy](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/25/opinion/thepoint#quintero-sheinbaum-trump-cartels). I have, to borrow a line from Peggy Noonan, a “certain idea of America.” He ain’t it.
  - What is that “certain idea”? It has to do with a type of democratic nobility, something most of us can recognize the moment we see it. It’s Sojourner Truth asking the suffragists at the 1851 Woman’s Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio, “[Ain’t I a woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V090_BhJw3Y&t=16s)?” It’s Lou Gehrig, stricken with A.L.S. in his 30s, [calling himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNLKPaThYkE) “the luckiest man on the face of the earth.”

  - It’s [Gail Halvorsen](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/us/gail-halvorsen-obituary.html), the candy bomber of the Berlin Airlift, parachuting chocolates and gum to the hungry children of the besieged city. It’s John McCain refusing an offer to be released before other American P.O.W.s in [North Vietnamese captivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YwnTnmbOMQ) — and, 40 years later, [publicly rebuking a supporter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIjenjANqAk) for calling Barack Obama, his opponent in the 2008 presidential race, “an Arab.”
  - It’s [Robert F. Kennedy after Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2kWIa8wSC0): “What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness; but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another.” It’s George H.W. Bush after [lightning victory in the Persion Gulf war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIpcTX4CMAY): “This is not a time of euphoria, certainly not a time to gloat.”
  - Democratic nobility is also found on a page I keep in my desk drawer, a passenger manifest of the ship that brought my 10-year-old mother to the United States, thanks to the Displaced Persons Act of 1948. Right below my mother’s name and nationality — “Stateless” — there is Jamil Issa Hasan, 26, Jordanian; Bruna Klar, 27, Italian; Martha Kohlhaupt, 41, German; and Gerda Nesselroth, 45, also stateless.
  - Soon to be Americans all.
  - What all of this boils down to is the self-restraint and compassion of the temporarily powerful, the self-respect and absence of self-pity of the temporarily weak, and the shared conviction that strong and weak are united in a common democratic creed. It’s what people used to admire about our national character — mythologized to some extent, but based in something real: understatement and confidence, decency and expectation, the America of Huck and Jim, Bogart and Hepburn, [Shepard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-shWpQ9Exg) and [Glenn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCx8vHpKylU).
  - This is what feels so wholly absent today. Those of us who count as coastal elites are expected to be deferential to the “real America” that elected this administration — one that’s supposedly more in tune with the country’s spirit than the Martha’s Vineyard set. Fine, please educate us.
  - But I struggle to understand what’s real in JD Vance’s shape-shifting political beliefs or Trump’s [meme coins](https://crypto.com/price/trumpcoin). I fail to see what’s American in denying due process to someone like Abrego Garcia, or in repeatedly threatening our neighbors and allies with treaty cancellations and possible conquest, or in cavalierly mulling an unconstitutional third term, or in [profiting from political office](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/trump-family-saudi-golf.html), or in arbitrarily sacking senior military officers and national security officials because a conspiracy theorist deems them to be disloyal. I don’t grasp the connection between Making America Great Again while tanking that symbol of American greatness known as Wall Street — all in the name of an economically illiterate and diplomatically ruinous obsession with tariffs and trade deficits.
  - The United States is a vast and diverse country and an old and resilient democracy that won’t quickly fold into authoritarianism and illiberalism the way Russia or Hungary did. The habits of freedom, 250 years old, still run deep in our bones — deeper than anything this president can ruin over the next few years. But that certain idea of America that once typified us, and for which we were once so admired, is evaporating.

  - Tracy Watkins is editor of The Post and Sunday Star-Times.OPINION: How to explain America? As the rest of the world grieves while US President Donald Trump [takes a wrecking ball to the global economy](https://www.thepost.co.nz/politics/360639794/trade-war-headwinds-worries-trumps-liberation-day-upends-global-economy), and ignores warnings of a devastating recession, American triumphalism is on full display.How do we explain away the fact that Trump was democratically elected with a powerful mandate to do just this; to put a bomb under economies and nations, even the poorest ones, and even his own, by starting a trade war with policies that no rational person, or anyone with a simple grasp of history, could possibly understand?
  - Is it collective American stupidity? Certainly that’s true of some of Trump’s supporters. They lap up his promise of American greatness, and lack any curiosity or understanding of the world beyond the USA, while nodding their heads along with Trump that the rest of the world is out to cheat them. Like so many other “facts” that they don’t want to hear, they have probably already dismissed as “fake news” any warning that Trump’s tariffs will only hurt jobs, and push up prices for American consumers.

  - PM echoes world stance on Trump tariffs: "It creates huge uncertainty"
  - But the stupid Americans explanation only gets us so far. It doesn’t explain why so many smart people have allowed Trump to cause so much damage.
  - America is full of smart people; it is a country that has bought us some of the smartest thinkers, and smartest innovators, in the world. The Republican Party as well is full of smart people. So why have so few spoken out? Why have so few tried to stop him?Trump is undermining almost everything thinking Republicans believe in. He is carelessly rejecting all sound economic thinking.
  - President Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in Washington.MARK SCHIEFELBEIN / AP
  - He is putting a boot into old alliances and friendships, describing America’s friends as worse than its enemies, and refuses to hear warnings of dark times ahead for America as a world trade war erupts.
  - Yet the resistance has been muted, though a few have been brave enough to put a stake in the ground. Senator Chuck Grassley, a senior Republican lawmaker from Iowa, is pushing for legislation that would reassert Congress’ authority over tariffs. In another move, four Republican senators joined Democrats in adopting a resolution to nullify the emergency powers Trump used to slap punitive tariffs on Canada and Mexico.
  - But both measures seem doomed to failure because the other Republican lawmakers will vote them down. There can be only a few explanations; either the rest of the Republican Party is buying into Trump’s craziness; or they see a benefit to themselves by backing Trump; or the climate of fear under President Trump is such that they fear the consequences of speaking out.
  - Donald Trump’s list of trade tariffs.
  - THE WHITE HOUSE
  - The last is not entirely self-serving or without reason; Trump’s madness, of course, is America’s madness; the American people voted for it. His mandate is not in question; he is the democratically elected American president.
  - To move against Trump now would be to move against the American people. And so we’re back to the explanation that stupid people put him there, because smart people underestimated him. They thought Trump was all hat, no trousers. They assumed that his wild talk about tariffs and trade retaliation was just….talk. That wiser counsel would prevail.
  - So they didn’t speak out. Too late now.
  - And so to the next question; could it happen here? Could New Zealand also elect a demagogue who throws rational arguments out the window, and plays on our prejudice and ignorance instead?
  - Watching some of the debate on social media yesterday, when too many Kiwis seemed to be stupidly repeating Trump’s view of GST as a trade barrier, it’s not impossible.
  - But in the midst of the turmoil of Trump’s so-called liberation day, it was refreshing, almost comforting, to hear Prime Minister Christopher Luxon’s response; that Trump’s tariffs were bad for the world economy, but we would not retaliate because the only people that would hurt is New Zealand consumers.
  - It was a rational, and predictable response - one that any PM in modern times would give, whether they were from Labour or National.
  - The strength of our political system is there is bipartisan agreement - in the majority anyway - on the fundamentals underpinning our economy and democracy.
  - And while our elections might seem increasingly presidential in appearance, our political system is protection against being hostage to the whims of one person.
  - If a leader, or even the prime minister, starts to act irrationally and against the interests of New Zealand, the caucus can remove them with a simple vote.
  - There are few special powers that go with being PM; they can’t go over the heads of their Cabinet or caucus to make or change laws using their executive powers . Only a majority of an MMP Parliament can make laws.
  - It’s a system that produces largely predictable, even boring, politics.
  - But to be honest, boring is looking pretty good to me right now.

### Republicans magic math

- [Senate Republicans’ magic math could jeopardize Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill”  | Salon.com](https://www.salon.com/2025/04/07/senate-republicans-magic-math-could-jeopardize-trumps-one-big-beautiful-bill/)
  - Senate Republicans’ magic math could jeopardize Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill”  | [Salon.com](http://salon.com/)
  - No one likes doing chores, but they don’t magically go away by ignoring them. If you don’t mow your lawn, the grass doesn’t stop growing. It becomes jungle-like; a much bigger headache if you don’t take care of it when you were supposed to. And, worst of all, even when you do your chores, you’ll have to do them again soon, over and over again. Death, taxes and chores. Wouldn’t it be nice to instead live in a world where if you just did them once, you’d be set forever? [Republicans in Congress are pretending](https://www.salon.com/topic/republicans) they live in that world. But instead of skipping household chores, they want to skip the part of governing where they have to pay for their plans.
  - Republicans are pushing tax cuts that would [balloon](https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_merkley_neal_boyle_release_new_estimate_of_republican_tax_planpdf.pdf) America’s debt by $4.6 trillion over the next decade in order to funnel money back to the wealthy. When you [combine](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/news/250319/illustrative-distributional-effects-policies-consistent-house-concurrent-budget-resolution-fiscal) their proposed tax cuts with their cuts to social programs and the poorest 20% of Americans would lose $1,125 per year while the top 0.1% would gain $180,910. They, of course, know this proposal that [President Trump](http://salon.com/topic/donald_trump) has branded “one big, beautiful bill” is unpopular for many reasons, so they’re trying to fudge the numbers.
  - There are two pieces to this. Let’s start with the first: the way Senate Republicans are trying to pass this law, a process known as “budget reconciliation.”
  - For legislation to get through the Senate, it normally needs 60 votes, otherwise, a single senator can block it with a filibuster. In 1974, though, Congress conjured up the budget reconciliation process, which allows the Senate to pass legislation that meets certain rules with only 51 votes—a simple majority. Today’s congressional gridlock and partisanship make it rare for a bipartisan group of 60 senators to agree to anything, let alone a spending bill. That’s why senators from both parties rely on budget reconciliation to pass major legislation, like the American Rescue Plan, the Inflation Reduction Act and tax cuts.
  - There are three key rules a bill needs to qualify for budget reconciliation. First, Congress can only use the budget reconciliation process once per fiscal year—you get one bite at the apple.
  - Second, under the “Byrd Rule” (named after former Senator Robert Byrd), legislation cannot increase the deficit after ten years. That’s why Congress designs many of its policies to “sunset,” or phase out over ten years.
  - And, third, any policy passed through budget reconciliation must directly affect federal spending, revenue, or the debt limit. Historically, the nonpartisan Senate “parliamentarian” has played a role in determining whether budget reconciliation bills stay within the rules. For example, much to the chagrin of many Democrats, the parliamentarian [ruled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/immigration-reconciliation-democrats-agenda/2021/09/20/bee98da2-1a29-11ec-a99a-5fea2b2da34b_story.html) during the Biden administration that raising the minimum wage and implementing certain immigration reforms did not qualify.
  - This brings us to the next part: an accounting gimmick.
  - A bit of background: President Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—passed via reconciliation—cut individuals’ income tax rates, slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and doubled the standard deduction taxpayers can claim on their refunds. But to follow the strict rules of budget reconciliation, Congress had to let key provisions expire, most notably the reduction of individual income tax rates.
  - Now, Republicans want to extend the Trump tax cuts, but they don’t want to be held accountable for an expensive bill nor do they want to just pass another set of cuts that will sunset again. To bypass these challenges, they’re trying to game how the bill is “scored”—or how Congress estimates the cost of policies. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office [scores](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59085) bills using a “current law baseline.” Essentially, it calculates what would happen to the country’s deficit and debt if a law passes, compared to a world in which the law does not pass. It’s a simple, intuitive and fair method.
  - The problem facing Republicans is that the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation concluded that their bill would [add](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/04/03/congress/dems-tout-new-jct-estimate-showing-gop-tax-cuts-could-be-costlier-than-anticipated-00271570) $4.6 trillion to the debt. Fearing Americans will get a sticker shock, Republicans decided to change the scoring rules and use a “current policy baseline” instead. Under this method, they could score their bill by pretending that none of today’s laws—like the Trump tax cuts—will ever expire. By doing so, extending any of today’s laws will appear free.
  - What they’re arguing is simple enough: they mowed their lawn once already, why do they have to do it again? It’s a question many a child asks. Unfortunately, the stakes of this are far greater than a petulant child refusing to do their chores. That growing grass is our country’s debt; if they don’t deal with it now, it’ll be left a mess for future generations to clean up.
  - What’s more, by pulling this accounting trick, Republicans think they can also make the tax cuts permanent. You’ll remember that the rules of budget reconciliation demand that legislation does not increase the deficit after ten years. By pretending that the 2017 tax cuts are already permanent, Republicans can further pretend that passing this new law won’t change the deficit.  Senator Lindsay Graham, the chairman of the Budget Committee, [states](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/us/politics/republicans-senate-rules-tax-cuts.html) it openly: “I have determined that current policy will be the budget base line regarding taxation. This will allow the tax cuts to be permanent.”
  - You might be asking, “Didn’t you say the parliamentarian makes those calls?” Historically, that has been the case. But over the weekend, Senate Republicans sidestepped the parliamentarian to jam through their budget blueprint, the first procedural step in passing the tax plan. They’re threatening to keep her sidelined throughout the legislative process so that Senate Republicans can interpret Senate rules in whichever way they see fit. Now when you strip away the procedures and the calculations, it’s clear what’s happening: Senate Republicans are pushing through a tax cut for the wealthy that will blow up the country’s debt. It’s not too hard to see because it’s part of a [pattern](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/tax-cuts-are-primarily-responsible-for-the-increasing-debt-ratio/). Since the turn of the century, tax cuts are responsible for 57% of the increase in the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio, a measure economists rely upon to see if our debt burden is becoming unmanageable. What’s more, if you strip out the one-time emergency spending Congress did to respond to the Great Recession and COVID-19, tax cuts are responsible for 90% of the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio.
  - The difference this time is that to pass these tax cuts, Senate Republicans took unprecedented steps to violate the Senate’s own procedures. They think they have the political cover to do so because today’s newscycle is dominated by President Trump’s [tariffs](https://www.salon.com/2025/04/04/tariffs-regime-aims-for-much-bigger-than-a-global-trade/) and their cataclysmic effects on markets rather than arcane topics like legislative processes and budget scoring.
  - And they feel they have do it this way because they know how things are starting to look. They claim to be the party of fiscal conservatism and their leaders bemoan the national debt, but this plan blows up the debt. They ran on lowering costs, but the Trump tariffs [reignite](https://www.wsj.com/video/fed-chair-powell-tariffs-increases-will-lead-to-higher-inflation/79C5BE3B-BFC2-4FA1-BC30-B7D90FCEB7BA) inflation. They have adopted the mantle of working class champions, but they’ve designed a plan to benefit the wealthy and hurt the poor. It’s no surprise why they are trying to hide from their responsibilities.

  - In his quest to make America great, President Donald Trump is withdrawing the United States from global trade. American families, companies, and investors will pay a price for this, as many commentators have noted. But the repercussions don’t end there. The tariff regime is also destroying a pillar of American global power, and it will further isolate the country at a moment when others stand ready to fill the vacuum.
  - On Wednesday, Trump [announced](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-02-2025/card/how-trump-s-new-tariffs-will-impact-countries-differently-jacLhiMw64agnWsIjMbA) that America would impose a 10 percent duty on imports from virtually all countries, plus additional punitive tariffs on countries he deems bad actors on trade, including Japan and members of the European Union. Some of these duties are extremely high. Adding the new levies to those previously imposed, China’s average tariff rate is now near 70 percent. Trump [described](https://rollcall.com/2025/04/02/donald-trump-tariffs-economy-liberation-day/) the tariffs as payback: “Foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream,” he said. “Our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not going to happen anymore.”
  - Trump’s tariffs are the culmination of a decades-long shift in political perceptions in the United States, in which trade has gone from an unalloyed good to the source of all ills. The U.S. once sought to bring down barriers and open markets globally—forging trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, and supporting the World Trade Organization. The resulting global trading system lowered the cost of goods, which benefited the companies and consumers of wealthy countries such as the United States. It also connected poorer countries, such as China, to international supply chains, allowing them to create jobs, woo investment, and alleviate poverty. The United States became, in effect, the world’s ultimate consumer, which tied other countries to its economy and its interests.
  - [Annie Lowrey: Here are the places where the recession has already begun](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/recession-tariffs-canada-trump/682297/)
  - Trade was a glue that held the American-led international order together. But economics always involves trade-offs. As supply chains stretched across the globe in search of lower costs, many factories vanished from the American heartland. Some Americans fastened on trade as the source of the inequality and constrained mobility that plagued the country’s middle and working classes; populist politicians encouraged these sentiments.
  - Strategically, too, trade’s promise seemed unrealized: Experts and politicians had assured Americans after the Cold War that economic exchange would transform China and Russia into peaceful partners. Within a couple of decades, these powers had clearly become authoritarian competitors instead.
  - The Trump team sold its tariffs program as a bid to set things straight by forcing America’s lost factories to return home. “You’re going to see the greatest resurgence of factory building and factory production in America,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick [said](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/cnbc-transcript-united-states-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-speaks-with-cnbcs-squawk-box-today.html?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) in defense of the tariffs. Trump is “changing the way people think about production in America.”
  - The results are unlikely to be what the administration anticipates. Some foreign companies may indeed respond to the tariffs by building factories in the U.S. to maintain their presence in a crucial market. But many others are simply too small, or too integrated into existing supply chains, to make that move. Where the millions of American workers will come from to screw together iPhones or make car parts is also a mystery, especially given the president’s opposition to large-scale immigration. Factories in the U.S. are already struggling to find workers; the manufacturing sector has hundreds of thousands of vacant openings.
  - Trump has long complained that some other countries tilt trade in their own favor. The White House, in [explaining](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-our-sovereignty-and-strengthen-our-national-and-economic-security/) its tariff regime, cited practices by other countries, including currency manipulation and onerous product standards that inhibit imports, that have been real concerns. But the tariff regime may soon lay bare the inconvenient truth of comparative advantage: Certain goods are made outside the U.S. because factories elsewhere can produce them more cheaply and efficiently. Lower costs are a big factor, but so is competence. Many manufacturers in China and elsewhere have developed skills and expertise that make them highly competitive.
  - The likely outcome of Trump’s policy will be high prices for what Americans make and buy, whether produced at home at greater cost than abroad or imported from overseas with a punitive tax. By one [estimate](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-stokes-trade-war-world-reels-tariff-shock-2025-04-03/), tariffs could hike the price of a top-end iPhone to $2,300. The Trump team seems to accept this. “Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent [said](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/06/treasury-secretary-bessent-says-the-american-dream-is-not-about-access-to-cheap-goods.html) in March. But when consumers buy fewer products at higher prices, companies produce and sell less and hire fewer workers, and [growth slows](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/piie-experts-react-trumps-tariffs-announced-april-2). As French President Emmanuel Macron [put it](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20250403-macron-calls-on-europe-to-suspend-investment-in-us-after-trump-tariff-shock), Trump’s policy will make Americans “weaker and poorer.”
  - Americans will not be the only ones to suffer in a global trade war. Other countries will likely respond to U.S. tariffs by erecting protectionist barriers of their own. China has already [announced](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-tariffs-trade-war-04-04-2025/card/china-retaliates-with-34-tariff-on-u-s-goods-3WvyupwMPTPnA8XWy6W9) an additional 34 percent tariff on U.S. imports. The EU is threatening to [retaliate](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/eu-preparing-further-countermeasures-to-us-tariffs-if-negotiations-fail-ec-president-von-der-leyen.html) too. The global trade that was once an engine of prosperity may now reverse and become a source of economic competition.
  - Other countries long accepted U.S. leadership because they saw Washington as a proponent of global economic progress. The role Trump is choosing for the United States is not that. He may eventually roll back tariffs for those countries that negotiate with him, and he may even see this as a show of kingpin-like strength: Trump has already [said](https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-says-china-could-get-tariff-relief-if-it-approves-tiktok-deal-2025-04-03/) that he’d be willing to reduce duties on China in return for a deal involving TikTok. But the erratic and arbitrary nature of the policies, and the willingness to exploit U.S. economic might to extort concessions, will undermine American standing nearly everywhere.
  - [Rogé Karma: Trump’s tariffs are designed to backfire](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/trump-tariff-theory-reality/682279/)
  - In fact, the administration’s tariff policy opens opportunities for Beijing, of all players, to portray itself as the more responsible global leader. In a meeting just days before Trump’s announcement, ministers from China, Japan, and South Korea issued a [statement](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-china-japan-agree-promote-regional-trade-trump-tariffs-loom-2025-03-30/) pledging to promote global trade.
  - That two of Washington’s closest allies would join Beijing in implicit criticism of the U.S. highlights the danger. The U.S. remains the world’s largest economy and a key market for many countries’ exports. But it is not the only game in town, either. A social-media account associated with CCTV, a Chinese state broadcaster, posted a graphic showing the extensive trade agreements that America’s partners have with one another and commented that, with the new tariffs, the U.S. is “shutting itself out of the world of free trade.” These countries will continue to expand their economic ties whatever Trump does. During his first term, after Trump withdrew the U.S. from a major trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, participants completed the pact on their own.
  - Tariffs are not going to make other countries respect the United States. But they can make them move on without it.

  - On Monday night, the Supreme Court issued [a 5–4 decision](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a931_2c83.pdf) lifting Judge James Boasberg’s temporary restraining order against the mass deportation of Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The majority held that the migrants had [filed the wrong kind of lawsuit](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/04/supreme-court-analysis-trump-el-salvador.html) in the wrong court, ordering them to file narrower claims—called habeas petitions—in Texas, where they’re detained. The opinion also glancingly affirmed the migrants’ right to due process, while making it significantly harder for them to vindicate that right in court.
  - In a special Tuesday episode of [Amicus](https://slate.com/podcasts/amicus) for Slate Plus, Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the court’s shadow docket ruling and its bleak implications for the Supreme Court’s broader response to Donald Trump’s lawlessness. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.
  - **Dahlia Lithwick: There are a couple of fascinating things about Monday’s order. One is that it came down as an unsigned “per curiam” opinion on the shadow docket. So we don’t know who wrote it. Another is that it’s boys versus girls, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the liberals in dissent. But Barrett didn’t agree with everything Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. What exactly was she on board with?**
  - **Mark Joseph Stern:** Justice Barrett did not sign on to Justice Sotomayor’s extraordinary rhetoric about the Trump administration’s violations of the rule of law. The one really substantive rebuttal that Barrett signed onto in full is the procedural aspect, where Sotomayor told the majority: _Are you crazy? These are not habeas cases!_ Habeas petitions are a challenge to your detention by the government. But migrants aren’t asking to be released from detention—they’re asking to _stay_ in detention here rather than get sent abroad! The majority made up this brand new rule that these cases must be filed as habeas petitions anyway.
  - Remember, Justice Barrett was a civil procedure professor at Notre Dame Law School for years. She is an expert in these topics. The fact that she signed onto this part of Sotomayor’s dissent is a very strong indication that the majority was indeed wrong on the law.
  - **I think Barrett is worried about questions of the rule of law, but she was never going to sign off on Sotomayor’s soaring rhetoric here. Then there’s the very different issue of John Roberts. A few short weeks ago, we had John Roberts,** **[the magisterial institutionalist](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/03/john-roberts-trump-supreme-court-orders-deportation.html)** **[who stuck his neck out](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/03/constitutional-crisis-john-roberts-vs-trump-administration.html)** **for Judge Boasberg after Trump said he needed to be impeached. Did he just throw Boasberg under the bus?**
  - I think Roberts completely threw Judge Boasberg under the bus. I mean, this was a shadow docket case, where there’s a bunch of fuzzy considerations that give the court a ton of latitude to consider extralegal questions: the balance of the equities, irreparable harm, whether the government has come to the court with clean hands. So even if Roberts agreed with the other men on this habeas issue, he could have said: _You know what? In this compressed timeline and emergency posture, I don’t think the government has earned the right for this extraordinary intervention_. And he could have denied the government’s request. He didn’t have to say a thing.

  - Watching the wild lines of the S&P 500, U.S. Treasury bond yields, and various foreign markets is how I’ve spent most of the past week. This felt familiar; I’d spent much of 2017 doing the same, following the vagaries of the first Trump administration and tracking the markets’ reactions like a nurse checking a patient’s heart rate.
  - But despite that familiarity, this isn’t the same as last time. I actually wish it were. This time, there’s no coming back from this quickly. Whoever is elected the 48th president won’t be able to easily rebuild what Donald Trump is busy destroying. Countries can and will move on without the United States. Their firms will establish new supply chains and pursue other markets. Even if the U.S. were the ultra-dominant trading partner it used to be, the credibility of the nation’s promises, its treaties, its agreements, and even its basic rationality has evaporated in just weeks.
  - The first Trump administration flirted with protectionism, but nothing like what the second Trump administration is trying now. Those earlier efforts seem quaint in hindsight. Not only were tariffs imposed selectively on specific goods such as solar panels and aluminum, but they were much smaller in size and escalated gradually over the course of 2018 and 2019. This was trivial compared with the plans launched and unlaunched over the past 10 days that have sent bond markets reeling. Usually, investors in search of a haven from a plummeting stock market will flee to buy safe, reliable U.S. Treasury bonds, but the opposite seems to be happening, indicating that investors [no longer view the U.S. government as the safest bet in town](https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/04/trump-tariff-pause-damage/682390/).
  - America sports a half-earned cockiness that has mostly served the country well. But as the _Financial Times_’ Tej Parikh [pointed out earlier this week](https://www.ft.com/content/1efd0fd7-89a0-4b1e-8b3a-349b10e6e166), the United States “isn’t the main driver of global trade growth,” and despite being the world’s largest economy, just over 13 percent of world imports flowed into its borders (as of November 2024). Instead of reshaping trade partnerships to further benefit the U.S., it could be left behind. One [analysis](https://globaltradealert.org/reports/americas-trade-policy-reversal) Parikh cites—as something of a thought experiment, hopefully—tries to model what would happen to America’s trading partners if the country were to be _fully_ closed to trade in 2025. That analysis predicts that, within the year, nearly 41 percent of U.S. trading partners would have fully recovered from the lost U.S. exports, and by 2029, 100 out of 144 trading partners would have recovered _the entirety_ of their loss of U.S. sales because of the expected growth in other economies.

  - America’s economic dominance has long been supported by alliances, faith in U.S. debt, and the independence of the Fed. Those three things “were all built on trust that took decades to build,” the economist Ernie Tedeschi told me. Over the course of the rest of Trump’s new term in office, “they could be decimated, taking decades more to rebuild, assuming our politics even has the energy to do it.”
  - This will be a painful process. Firms will go out of business, workers will lose their jobs, and the world will be poorer for it. But it can move on without us. As the economist Scott Lincicome pointed out earlier this year, [countries have not stalled on signing free-trade agreements](https://www.cato.org/commentary/it-was-never-really-about-trade-all). In just the past few days, the [European Union and the United Arab Emirates have launched free-trade talks](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/read_25_1043), as have the [EU and Australia](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/radionational-breakfast/eu-trade-germany/105163868), the [United Kingdom and India](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/trump-tariff-india-uk-trade-ties-nirmala-sitharaman-b2730095.html); and senior officials from [China, Japan, and South Korea have already held their first trade talks in five years](https://www.dw.com/en/china-japan-and-south-korea-to-strengthen-free-trade/a-72085756).
  - The problem facing future administrations—and this one, in the unlikely event that it gains a modicum of rationality—is that the country has killed its reliability. “Trump has unilaterally decided that _I’m going to wreck the credibility of international agreements_,” Skanda Amarnath, the executive director of the research and advocacy organization Employ America, explained to me. “If you’re a manufacturer, industrial firm,” he said, “what is the confidence you have that the rules are not going to change for arbitrary and capricious reasons?”
  - Trump himself is certainly to blame. Yet many of the people I have spoken with lay blame at the feet not of the president, but of the legislature, which refuses to assert itself as a co-equal branch of government.
  - The right to levy taxes is reserved for Congress, not the president. To enact these tariffs, Trump is using emergency powers that he has invoked because of what he views as a [“national emergency posed by the large and persistent trade deficit”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-our-sovereignty-and-strengthen-our-national-and-economic-security/) between the U.S. and other countries. This is a breathtaking use of these powers; the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 was meant for an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” which, of course, trade deficits are not. According to the [Brennan Center for Justice](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-president-misusing-emergency-powers-impose-worldwide-tariffs), no president has ever invoked tariff authority through this law. As a result, Congress or the courts could constrain him. “Somebody in the federal government is going to need to demonstrate that these laws on the books are not blank checks for a single individual to destroy trillions of dollars of wealth with the stroke of a pen,” Lincicome argued to me.
  - It was once possible to believe that Trump’s first reign was a fluke, a glitch, a deviation from the slow, unyielding march of liberal democracy. After all, he lost the popular vote in 2016, carried into the presidency on an Electoral College bias that discounted the votes and voices of millions. Moreover, he was deeply unprepared for the actual job of being president, his campaign having been shunned by most of the Republican establishment that had experience running White Houses past.
  - When former President Joe Biden ran for election in 2020, he did so to restore normalcy. In his announcement video, he proclaimed, “I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time.” No such luck.
  - A principled ideologue can be more dangerous than a craven politician. Trump may have paused some of the tariffs enacted earlier this week, but he’s still plowing ahead with the largest trade war America has seen since the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. The bond markets are in [serious trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/business/economy/treasury-bonds-tariffs.html), and Trump’s polling on his handling of [the economy](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/51986-donald-trump-declining-popularity-tariffs-third-term-the-economy-april-5-8-2025-economist-yougov-poll) is plummeting. But the president seems remarkably stalwart. He is, it turns out, a true believer. Wrong as he may be, Trump is behaving like a man seeking an age-defining legacy.
  - I’ll bet he gets one.

  - *Analysis* - We now have a clearer picture of Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs and how they will [affect other trading nations](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/02/trump-hits-uk-with-10-tariffs-as-he-ignites-global-trade-war), including the United States itself.
  - The US administration claims these tariffs on imports will reduce the US trade deficit and address what it views as unfair and non-reciprocal trade practices. Trump said this would "forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed".
  - The "reciprocal" tariffs are designed to impose charges on other countries equivalent to half the costs they supposedly inflict on US exporters through tariffs, currency manipulation and non-tariff barriers levied on US goods.
  - Each nation received a tariff number that will apply to most goods. Notable sectors exempt include steel, aluminium and motor vehicles, which are already subject to new tariffs.

 Universities in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union thought giving in to government demands would save their independence

Many American universities, [widely seen globally as beacons of academic integrity](https://www.higheredtoday.org/2024/06/11/higher-ed-greatest-defense/) and free speech, [are giving in to demands](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/universities-trump-lobbyists-funding-washington-a2e5c77a?mod=hp_lead_pos11) from the Trump administration, which [has been targeting](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/opinion/trump-higher-education.html) academia since it took office.

In one of his first acts, President Donald Trump [branded diversity, equity and inclusion programs as discriminatory](http://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-takes-action-eliminate-dei). His administration also launched [federal investigations](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/14/g-s1-53831/dei-universities-education-department-investigation) into [more than 50 universities](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/office-civil-rights-initiates-title-vi-investigations-institutions-of-higher-education-0), from smaller regional schools such as Grand Valley State University in Michigan and the New England College of Optometry in Massachusetts to elite private universities such as Harvard and Yale.

Trump ramped up the pressure by [threatening university research funding](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00849-y) and targeting specific schools. In one example, the Trump administration revoked US$400 million in grants to Columbia University over its alleged failures to curb antisemitic harassment on campus. The [school later agreed to most of Trump’s demands](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/nyregion/columbia-response-trump-demands.html), from tightening student protest policies to placing an entire academic department under administrative oversight – though the funding remains frozen.

[Cornell, Northwestern](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/cornell-northwestern-university-funds-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare&sgrp=p&pvid=D4D2DF31-EE60-4ACE-9E71-A5F436D54347), [Princeton](https://apnews.com/article/princeton-trump-federal-funding-9c32a996256849ac00792ef50dbdfb0e), [Brown](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/trump-administration-brown-university-funding-pause.html) and the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/20/nx-s1-5333675/university-pennsylvania-upenn-trump-suspends-funding-trans-student-athletes) have also recently had grants frozen. [Harvard was sent a list of demands](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/trump-harvard-funding-demands.html?smid=url-share) in order to keep $9 billion in federal funding.

Now, across the United States, many universities are trying to [avoid being Trump’s next target](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/colleges-trump-dei-funding-changes-4b60c0bb). Administrators are [dismantling DEI initiatives](https://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-higher-eds-dismantling-of-dei?sra=true) – closing and rebranding offices, eliminating positions, revising training programs and sanitizing diversity statements – while professors are preemptively [self-censoring](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/diversity-equity/2025/02/06/trump-attacks-dei-faculty-pick-between-silence).

Not all institutions are complying. Some schools, such as [Wesleyan](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/opinion/trump-jewish-antisemitism-wesleyan.html?partner=slack&smid=sl-share), [have refused to abandon](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/nyregion/trump-dei-executive-orders-schools.html) their diversity principles. And organizations including the [American Association of University Professors](https://www.aaup.org/report/against-anticipatory-obedience) [have filed lawsuits](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/02/18/trump-administration-faces-growing-number-lawsuits) challenging Trump’s executive orders, arguing they violate academic freedom and the First Amendment.

But these remain exceptions, as the [broader trend leans](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/race-ethnicity/2025/03/17/colleges-flag-words-women-comply-dei-bans#) toward institutional caution and retreat.

As a scholar of comparative and international education, I [study how academic institutions respond](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-TOk9DEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) to authoritarian pressure – across political systems, cultural contexts and historical moments. While some universities may believe that [compliance with the administration](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/universities-trump-lobbyists-funding-washington-a2e5c77a?mod=hp_lead_pos11) will protect their funding and independence, a [few historical parallels suggest otherwise](https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/how-democracies-die).

Students and other Nazi supporters gather at Humboldt University in Berlin in 1933. [AP Photo](https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/HitlerYouthRally1933/53f1cc9869644449a2cbf1b18c9fa123/photo?Query=German%20university%20hitler&mediaType=photo&sortBy=creationdatetime:desc&dateRange=Anytime&totalCount=13&currentItemNo=12)

German universities: A lesson


In the 1975 book “[The Abuse of Learning: The Failure of German Universities](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Abuse_of_Learning.html?id=SzgQAQAAMAAJ),” historian Frederic Lilge chronicles how German universities, which entered the 20th century in a [golden age](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198206606.003.0010) of global intellectual influence, did not resist the Nazi regime but instead adapted to it.

Even before seizing national power in 1933, the Nazi Party was closely monitoring German universities through [nationalist student groups](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/university-student-groups-in-nazi-germany) and [sympathetic faculty](https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/controlling-universities), flagging professors deemed politically unreliable – particularly Jews, Marxists, liberals and pacifists.

After Hitler took office in 1933, his regime moved [swiftly to purge](https://heritage.umich.edu/stories/in-the-face-of-fascists) academic institutions of Jews and political opponents. The 1933 [Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/timeline-event/holocaust/1933-1938/law-for-the-restoration-of-the-professional-civil-service) mandated the firing of Jewish and other “non-Aryan” professors and members of the faculty deemed politically suspect.

Soon after, professors were required to swear loyalty to Hitler, curricula were overhauled to emphasize “national defense” and “[racial science](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674018426)” – a pseudoscientific framework used to justify antisemitism and Aryan supremacy – and entire departments were restructured to serve Nazi ideology.

Some institutions, such as the Technische Hochschule Stuttgart, [even rushed to honor Hitler](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Abuse_of_Learning.html?id=SzgQAQAAMAAJ) with an honorary doctorate within weeks of his rise to power. He declined the offer, though the gesture signaled the university’s eagerness to align with the regime. Professional associations, such as the Association of German Universities, stayed silent, ignoring key opportunities to resist before universities lost their autonomy and became subservient to the Nazi state.

As linguist Max Weinreich wrote in his 1999 book “[Hitler’s Professors](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300053876/hitlers-professors/),” many academics didn’t just comply, they enabled the regime by reshaping their research. This legitimized state doctrine, helping build the intellectual framework of the regime.

A [few academics resisted and were dismissed](https://perspectives.ushmm.org/collection/higher-education-in-nazi-germany), exiled or executed. Most did not.

[The transformation of German academia](https://perspectives.ushmm.org/collection/higher-education-in-nazi-germany?utm_source=chatgpt.com) was not a slow drift but a swift and systemic overhaul. But what made Hitler’s orders stick was the eagerness of many academic leaders to comply, justify and normalize the new order. Each decision – each erased name, each revised syllabus, each closed program and department – was framed as necessary, even patriotic. Within a few years, German universities no longer served knowledge – they served power.

It would take more than a decade after the war, through [denazification, reinvestment and international reintegration](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674009332), for West German universities to begin regaining their intellectual standing and academic credibility.

![a group of students stand in a room with two big columns and a mural of soviet propaganda on the wall](https://images.theconversation.com/files/658809/original/file-20250331-56-bu1b0h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip)

Under Stalin, dissenting scholars were purged and history rewritten to glorify the Communist Party. Moscow State University opened in 1953 with murals such as this one depicting Soviet symbols. [AP Photo/Zander Hollander](https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/MoscowUniversity1953/2c18fb83c1134f788ef5e9b27514f597/photo?Query=ussr%20university&mediaType=photo&sortBy=creationdatetime:desc&dateRange=Anytime&totalCount=47&currentItemNo=42)

USSR and fascist Italy suffer similar fate


Other countries that have fallen under authoritarian regimes followed similar trajectories.

In fascist Italy, the shift began not with violence but with a signature. In 1931, the Mussolini regime required all university professors to swear [an oath of loyalty to the state](https://www.chronicle.com/article/what-autocrats-want-from-academics-servility). Out of more than 1,200, only 12 refused.

Many justified their compliance by insisting the oath had no bearing on their teaching or research. But by publicly affirming loyalty and offering no organized resistance, the academic community signaled its willingness to accommodate the regime. This lack of opposition allowed the fascist government to tighten control over universities and use them to advance its ideological agenda.

In the Soviet Union, this control was not limited to symbolic gestures – it reshaped the entire academic system.

After the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Bolsheviks oscillated between wanting to abolish universities as “feudal relics” and repurposing them to serve a socialist state, as historians [John Connelly](https://history.berkeley.edu/john-connelly) and [Michael Grüttner](https://www.dzhw.eu/en/gmbh/mitarbeiter?m_id=662) explain in their book “[Universities Under Dictatorship](https://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-02695-4.html?srsltid=AfmBOopHledCIIirKtG2Gs75E7RgNu1XC-uhyb5YLJP8OWEdxTBmUbUO).” Ultimately, they chose the latter, remaking universities as instruments of ideological education and technical training, tightly aligned with Marxist-Leninist goals.

Under Josef Stalin, [academic survival depended less](https://press.princeton.edu/books/ebook/9781400822140/stalinist-science-pdf) on scholarly merit than on conformity to official doctrine. Dissenting scholars were purged or exiled, history was rewritten to glorify the Communist Party, and entire disciplines such as genetics [were reshaped](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/12/trofim-lysenko-soviet-union-russia/548786/) to fit political orthodoxy.

[This model was exported](https://uncpress.org/book/9780807848654/captive-university/) across Eastern and Central Europe during the Cold War. In East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland, ministries dictated curricula, Marxism-Leninism became mandatory across disciplines, and admissions were reengineered to favor students from loyalist backgrounds. In some contexts, adherents to older intellectual traditions pushed back, especially in Poland, where resistance slowed though could not prevent the imposition of ideological control.

By the early 1950s, universities across the region had become what Connelly calls “[captive institutions](https://uncpress.org/book/9780807848654/captive-university/),” stripped of independence and recast to serve the state.

A more recent example is Turkey, where, following the [failed 2016 coup](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/turkey-how-the-coup-failed/), more than [6,000 academics were dismissed](https://www.chronicle.com/article/turkeys-university-leaders-are-expected-to-face-loyalty-inquiries/), [universities were shuttered](https://theconversation.com/why-turkey-wants-to-silence-its-academics-62885) and research deemed “subversive” was banned.

History’s warning


The Trump administration’s early and direct intervention into higher education governance echoes historical attempts to bring universities under state influence or control.

The administration says it is doing so [to eradicate “discriminatory” DEI policies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/) and [fight what it sees as antisemitism on college campuses](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/). But by [withholding federal funding](https://apnews.com/article/columbia-university-funding-trump-fa70143c715df8fd4ef337c0e1ccf872), the administration is also trying to force universities into ideological conformity – by dictating whose knowledge counts but also whose presence and perspectives are permissible on campus.

[Columbia’s reaction to Trump’s demands](https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/2025-03-24-columbias-capitulation-wesleyans-pushback/) sent a clear message: Resistance is risky, but compliance may be rewarded – though the [$400 million has yet to be restored](https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2025/03/23/columbia-on-right-track-toward-final-negotiations-to-restore-canceled-federal-funds-mcmahon-says/). The speed and scope of its concessions set a precedent, signaling to other universities that avoiding political fallout now may mean rewriting policies, reshaping departments and retreating from controversy, perhaps before anyone even asks.

The Trump administration has already moved on to other universities, including the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/20/nx-s1-5333675/university-pennsylvania-upenn-trump-suspends-funding-trans-student-athletes) over its transgender policies, [Princeton for its climate programs](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/08/princeton-university-funding-cuts-climate-programs) and [Harvard over alleged antisemitism](https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2025/03/31/trump-administration-reviewing-9-billion-in-government-funding-for-harvard/). The question is which school is next.

The Department of Education has [launched investigations into over 50 institutions](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/14/g-s1-53831/dei-universities-education-department-investigation), accusing them of using “racial preferences and stereotypes in education programs and activities.” How these institutions choose to respond may determine whether higher education remains a space for open inquiry.

The pressure to conform is not just financial – it is also cultural. Faculty at some institutions [are being advised](https://www.chronicle.com/article/what-autocrats-want-from-academics-servility?sra=true) not to use “DEI” in emails and public communication, with warnings to not be a target. Academics [are removing pronouns](https://azmirror.com/briefs/erased-how-trumps-executive-orders-are-dismantling-diversity-at-maricopa-county-community-colleges/) from their email signatures and asking their students to comply, too. I’ve been on the receiving end of those warnings, and so have my counterparts at other institutions. And students on visas are [being warned](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/brown-university-travel-professor-green-card-deportation-aa6bff14) [not to travel outside the U.S.](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/politics/international-students-not-to-travel-outside-us/3826245/) after several [were deported](https://apnews.com/article/trump-foreign-students-campus-gaza-protests-deportation-9e2d4abc1c158454da1f68c01062c9ef) or denied reentry due to alleged involvement in protests.

Meanwhile, people inside and outside academia [are combing websites, syllabi](https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-diversity-detective?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=campaign_12943645_nl_Academe-Today_date_20250319&sra=true), [presentations](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/a-teacher-prep-conference-warned-against-mentioning-dei-presenters-pulled-out/2025/03) and public writing in search of what they consider ideological infractions. This type of [peer surveillance](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2025/04/01/department-leaders-told-to-report-all-dei-initiatives/) can reward silence, incentivize erasure and turn institutions against their own.

When universities start regulating not just what they say but what they teach, support and stand for – driven by fear rather than principle – they are no longer just reacting to political threats, they are internalizing them. And as history has shown, that may mark the beginning of the end of their academic independence.

  - ---
  - Our bodies produce all kinds of substances, and people have different tolerance levels for them.
  - One that can be really bothersome is earwax. But believe it or not, this substance actually serves a purpose ― and you need to be careful when it comes to removing it.
  - Below, experts break down what you need to know about dealing with earwax and cleaning out your ears.
  -  **First of all, you probably don’t need to clean out your ears**
  - “Most people do not need to remove their ear wax,” said Dr. Erich P. Voigt, an associate professor in Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. “It is a protective coating of the ear canal. It is a waterproofing agent and has anti-microbial properties. It helps prevent outer ear infections.”
  - In addition to protecting your ears from water damage and infection, earwax also lubricates the ears, preventing the area from feeling dry and itchy. And like other [parts of the body](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/reasons-your-vagina-is-a-total-boss_n_6607722), ears are “self-cleaning,” so you don’t really need to wash the inside area.
  - “Think from an evolutionary standpoint,” said Dr. Lawrence R. Lustig, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. “If Mother Nature designed an ear that had to be cleaned, that would be a poor design. We didn’t have ear cleaners 500,000 years ago.”
  - He described the system as a “conveyer belt of skin.”
  - “Earwax is a combination of skin and oil,” Lustig said. “Skin migrates out from the eardrum to the outside of the ear canal, and as those migrating dead skin cells mix with the oil glands of the ear canal on the way out, that’s where you get earwax.”
  - Some people have a migration problem, produce too much wax or wax of an abnormal consistency. They might be prone to wax infections and require medical intervention to remove their earwax, which can block the ear and impair hearing. But for most of us, the wax clears out naturally as we go about our daily lives.
  - “The body has a system for creating wax and pushing it out,” said Dr. Bradley B. Block, an otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon and host of the “Physician’s Guide to Doctoring” podcast. “As you chew and talk, the ear canal skin moves, and this pushes the wax out. Interfering with this system can lead to wax getting pushed in and accumulating, clogging the ear canal, so cleaning the ears can have the paradoxical effect of clogging the ear.”

  - Your ears naturally clean themselves.
  -  **But if you insist on doing it, don’t use Q-tips**
  - When you ask people what Q-tips are meant for, their answers will likely include cleaning out earwax. This practice has become so commonplace that Kevin James’ character in “Hitch” [has a dance move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50YQeugOMOw) that mimics cleaning out the ears with a Q-tip.
  - But pop culture fans might also remember that brutal scene from “Girls” when Hannah inserts a Q-tip too far into her ear and accidentally punctures her eardrum. The packaging for Q-tip products today even contains a clear warning: “Do not insert inside the ear canal.”
  - Indeed, cotton swabs like Q-tips can scratch the ear canal and cause bleeding or even lead to ear drum damage. Bottom line: Cleaning out your ears with Q-tips is not a good idea.
  - “Think about diameter of ear canal and diameter of Q-tips,” Lustig said. “If you can’t see what you’re doing, you can end up sort of packing all that wax in with a Q-tips. A lot of the time it acts as a plunger. When I have someone come in with an earwax infection, half the time it’s because they used Q-tips.”
  - In addition to packing the wax deeper and potentially causing it to get trapped in the ear, cleaning out your ears with Q-tips can lead to outer ear infections.
  - “Stripping the wax out of the canal can also leave the skin dry, and dry skin can get itchy,” Block added. “This leads to a cycle of using cotton swabs to clean out the wax, which makes them itch, so then you scratch with cotton swabs, which makes them itch, etc.”
  - And bad news if you prefer using ear candles: In addition to causing other forms of potential harm, this method doesn’t seem to work.
  - “There have actually been studies to see the amount of wax that comes out,” Lustig said. “It doesn’t seem to help at all, and there’s the risk of burning your ear doing it. It was trendy for awhile, but I think that trend has worn off ― though I’m sure ear candles will eventually arise from the dead like Lazarus.”
  -  **The better method for cleaning your ears is much simpler**
  - If you’re still wanting to clean your ears, just focus on the outside area and any wax that’s already on its way out.
  - “My general recommendation for people is let the body do its job,” Lustig said. “Let that skin migration with the wax come out on its own. Take a wet washrag onto your finger and clean out whatever comes to the entry point.”
  - Both Block and Voigt recommended simply letting the normal showering and hair washing process clean the area.
  - “Just wipe the outside with a soapy finger or washcloth,” Block said.
  - There are also products like Debrox drops, which contain carbamide peroxide (a combination of hydrogen peroxide and urea) to help dissolve the earwax.
  - “I’ll often use that or straight up hydrogen peroxide,” Lustig said. “Hydrogen peroxide softens up those harder blocks. It’s safe to use assuming you don’t have a hole in your eardrum, which most people don’t. Sometimes the wax is really hard and we can use these mini tweezers called alligator forceps to clear it out. Sometimes it’s really soften and we suction it out.”
  - To clean out the ear with a solution like Debrox (or a similar solution of hydrogen peroxide and water, for instance), be sure follow the instructions on the product. Generally, the process involves lying on your side, administering a few drops, waiting a few minutes and then sitting up and blotting the area. You can then generally use warm water in the shower to flush out the ear.
  - Still, as previously noted you really don’t need to clean out your earwax unless there’s a problem ― and even then, it’s best to have a medical professional handle the process.
  - “The ear canal is sensitive and has a lot of nerve endings,” Lustig said. “A light touch that might feel like a tickle elsewhere can really hurt in the ear. So I wouldn’t go putting things in there. And you have to be careful when irrigating the ear not to perforate the eardrum. You have to be careful to direct the jet of fluid in the correct location on the back wall.”
  -  **See a doctor as soon as you notice an issue**
  - You’re not likely to experience issues with wax buildup, but if you do, be sure to seek professional help. When your ear canal gets blocked, you may feel like you have an earplug in all the time, experience difficulty hearing or feel like your voice is echoing when you talk.
  - Doctors can help clear out the wax and check for other issues. Lustig noted that what some people suspect to be wax infection can actually be a bigger problem.

  - “I’ve had patients come to see me with sudden hearing loss, and when I look in the ear, it’s clear and there’s no problem with the eardrum,” he said. “It turned out a virus got into the inner ear and caused inner ear damage.”
  - If you ever notice a sudden change in hearing, you should make an appointment with a professional as soon as possible.
  - “There are several things that can arise in the ear with a change in hearing that are worrisome or dangerous,” Lustig said. “And there’s a limited time window to treat it. Some other things that can mimic hearing loss are much more dangerous.”
