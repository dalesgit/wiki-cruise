    - Tracy Watkins is editor of The Post and Sunday Star-Times.OPINION: How to explain America? As the rest of the world grieves while US President Donald Trump [takes a wrecking ball to the global economy](https://www.thepost.co.nz/politics/360639794/trade-war-headwinds-worries-trumps-liberation-day-upends-global-economy), and ignores warnings of a devastating recession, American triumphalism is on full display.How do we explain away the fact that Trump was democratically elected with a powerful mandate to do just this; to put a bomb under economies and nations, even the poorest ones, and even his own, by starting a trade war with policies that no rational person, or anyone with a simple grasp of history, could possibly understand?
    - Is it collective American stupidity? Certainly that’s true of some of Trump’s supporters. They lap up his promise of American greatness, and lack any curiosity or understanding of the world beyond the USA, while nodding their heads along with Trump that the rest of the world is out to cheat them. Like so many other “facts” that they don’t want to hear, they have probably already dismissed as “fake news” any warning that Trump’s tariffs will only hurt jobs, and push up prices for American consumers.

    - PM echoes world stance on Trump tariffs: "It creates huge uncertainty"
    - But the stupid Americans explanation only gets us so far. It doesn’t explain why so many smart people have allowed Trump to cause so much damage.
    - America is full of smart people; it is a country that has bought us some of the smartest thinkers, and smartest innovators, in the world. The Republican Party as well is full of smart people. So why have so few spoken out? Why have so few tried to stop him?Trump is undermining almost everything thinking Republicans believe in. He is carelessly rejecting all sound economic thinking.
    - President Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in Washington.MARK SCHIEFELBEIN / AP
    - He is putting a boot into old alliances and friendships, describing America’s friends as worse than its enemies, and refuses to hear warnings of dark times ahead for America as a world trade war erupts.
    - Yet the resistance has been muted, though a few have been brave enough to put a stake in the ground. Senator Chuck Grassley, a senior Republican lawmaker from Iowa, is pushing for legislation that would reassert Congress’ authority over tariffs. In another move, four Republican senators joined Democrats in adopting a resolution to nullify the emergency powers Trump used to slap punitive tariffs on Canada and Mexico.
    - But both measures seem doomed to failure because the other Republican lawmakers will vote them down. There can be only a few explanations; either the rest of the Republican Party is buying into Trump’s craziness; or they see a benefit to themselves by backing Trump; or the climate of fear under President Trump is such that they fear the consequences of speaking out.
    - Donald Trump’s list of trade tariffs.
    - THE WHITE HOUSE
    - The last is not entirely self-serving or without reason; Trump’s madness, of course, is America’s madness; the American people voted for it. His mandate is not in question; he is the democratically elected American president.
    - To move against Trump now would be to move against the American people. And so we’re back to the explanation that stupid people put him there, because smart people underestimated him. They thought Trump was all hat, no trousers. They assumed that his wild talk about tariffs and trade retaliation was just….talk. That wiser counsel would prevail.
    - So they didn’t speak out. Too late now.
    - And so to the next question; could it happen here? Could New Zealand also elect a demagogue who throws rational arguments out the window, and plays on our prejudice and ignorance instead?
    - Watching some of the debate on social media yesterday, when too many Kiwis seemed to be stupidly repeating Trump’s view of GST as a trade barrier, it’s not impossible.
    - But in the midst of the turmoil of Trump’s so-called liberation day, it was refreshing, almost comforting, to hear Prime Minister Christopher Luxon’s response; that Trump’s tariffs were bad for the world economy, but we would not retaliate because the only people that would hurt is New Zealand consumers.
    - It was a rational, and predictable response - one that any PM in modern times would give, whether they were from Labour or National.
    - The strength of our political system is there is bipartisan agreement - in the majority anyway - on the fundamentals underpinning our economy and democracy.
    - And while our elections might seem increasingly presidential in appearance, our political system is protection against being hostage to the whims of one person.
    - If a leader, or even the prime minister, starts to act irrationally and against the interests of New Zealand, the caucus can remove them with a simple vote.
    - There are few special powers that go with being PM; they can’t go over the heads of their Cabinet or caucus to make or change laws using their executive powers . Only a majority of an MMP Parliament can make laws.
    - It’s a system that produces largely predictable, even boring, politics.
    - But to be honest, boring is looking pretty good to me right now.

    - # Senate Republicans’ magic math could jeopardize Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill”  | [Salon.com](http://salon.com/)
    - No one likes doing chores, but they don’t magically go away by ignoring them. If you don’t mow your lawn, the grass doesn’t stop growing. It becomes jungle-like; a much bigger headache if you don’t take care of it when you were supposed to. And, worst of all, even when you do your chores, you’ll have to do them again soon, over and over again. Death, taxes and chores. Wouldn’t it be nice to instead live in a world where if you just did them once, you’d be set forever? [Republicans in Congress are pretending](https://www.salon.com/topic/republicans) they live in that world. But instead of skipping household chores, they want to skip the part of governing where they have to pay for their plans.
    - Republicans are pushing tax cuts that would [balloon](https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_merkley_neal_boyle_release_new_estimate_of_republican_tax_planpdf.pdf) America’s debt by $4.6 trillion over the next decade in order to funnel money back to the wealthy. When you [combine](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/news/250319/illustrative-distributional-effects-policies-consistent-house-concurrent-budget-resolution-fiscal) their proposed tax cuts with their cuts to social programs and the poorest 20% of Americans would lose $1,125 per year while the top 0.1% would gain $180,910. They, of course, know this proposal that [President Trump](http://salon.com/topic/donald_trump) has branded “one big, beautiful bill” is unpopular for many reasons, so they’re trying to fudge the numbers.
    - There are two pieces to this. Let’s start with the first: the way Senate Republicans are trying to pass this law, a process known as “budget reconciliation.”
    - For legislation to get through the Senate, it normally needs 60 votes, otherwise, a single senator can block it with a filibuster. In 1974, though, Congress conjured up the budget reconciliation process, which allows the Senate to pass legislation that meets certain rules with only 51 votes—a simple majority. Today’s congressional gridlock and partisanship make it rare for a bipartisan group of 60 senators to agree to anything, let alone a spending bill. That’s why senators from both parties rely on budget reconciliation to pass major legislation, like the American Rescue Plan, the Inflation Reduction Act and tax cuts.
    - There are three key rules a bill needs to qualify for budget reconciliation. First, Congress can only use the budget reconciliation process once per fiscal year—you get one bite at the apple.
    - Second, under the “Byrd Rule” (named after former Senator Robert Byrd), legislation cannot increase the deficit after ten years. That’s why Congress designs many of its policies to “sunset,” or phase out over ten years.
    - And, third, any policy passed through budget reconciliation must directly affect federal spending, revenue, or the debt limit. Historically, the nonpartisan Senate “parliamentarian” has played a role in determining whether budget reconciliation bills stay within the rules. For example, much to the chagrin of many Democrats, the parliamentarian [ruled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/immigration-reconciliation-democrats-agenda/2021/09/20/bee98da2-1a29-11ec-a99a-5fea2b2da34b_story.html) during the Biden administration that raising the minimum wage and implementing certain immigration reforms did not qualify.
    - This brings us to the next part: an accounting gimmick.
    - A bit of background: President Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—passed via reconciliation—cut individuals’ income tax rates, slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and doubled the standard deduction taxpayers can claim on their refunds. But to follow the strict rules of budget reconciliation, Congress had to let key provisions expire, most notably the reduction of individual income tax rates.
    - Now, Republicans want to extend the Trump tax cuts, but they don’t want to be held accountable for an expensive bill nor do they want to just pass another set of cuts that will sunset again. To bypass these challenges, they’re trying to game how the bill is “scored”—or how Congress estimates the cost of policies. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office [scores](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59085) bills using a “current law baseline.” Essentially, it calculates what would happen to the country’s deficit and debt if a law passes, compared to a world in which the law does not pass. It’s a simple, intuitive and fair method.
    - The problem facing Republicans is that the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation concluded that their bill would [add](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/04/03/congress/dems-tout-new-jct-estimate-showing-gop-tax-cuts-could-be-costlier-than-anticipated-00271570) $4.6 trillion to the debt. Fearing Americans will get a sticker shock, Republicans decided to change the scoring rules and use a “current policy baseline” instead. Under this method, they could score their bill by pretending that none of today’s laws—like the Trump tax cuts—will ever expire. By doing so, extending any of today’s laws will appear free.
    - What they’re arguing is simple enough: they mowed their lawn once already, why do they have to do it again? It’s a question many a child asks. Unfortunately, the stakes of this are far greater than a petulant child refusing to do their chores. That growing grass is our country’s debt; if they don’t deal with it now, it’ll be left a mess for future generations to clean up.
    - What’s more, by pulling this accounting trick, Republicans think they can also make the tax cuts permanent. You’ll remember that the rules of budget reconciliation demand that legislation does not increase the deficit after ten years. By pretending that the 2017 tax cuts are already permanent, Republicans can further pretend that passing this new law won’t change the deficit.  Senator Lindsay Graham, the chairman of the Budget Committee, [states](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/us/politics/republicans-senate-rules-tax-cuts.html) it openly: “I have determined that current policy will be the budget base line regarding taxation. This will allow the tax cuts to be permanent.”
    - You might be asking, “Didn’t you say the parliamentarian makes those calls?” Historically, that has been the case. But over the weekend, Senate Republicans sidestepped the parliamentarian to jam through their budget blueprint, the first procedural step in passing the tax plan. They’re threatening to keep her sidelined throughout the legislative process so that Senate Republicans can interpret Senate rules in whichever way they see fit. Now when you strip away the procedures and the calculations, it’s clear what’s happening: Senate Republicans are pushing through a tax cut for the wealthy that will blow up the country’s debt. It’s not too hard to see because it’s part of a [pattern](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/tax-cuts-are-primarily-responsible-for-the-increasing-debt-ratio/). Since the turn of the century, tax cuts are responsible for 57% of the increase in the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio, a measure economists rely upon to see if our debt burden is becoming unmanageable. What’s more, if you strip out the one-time emergency spending Congress did to respond to the Great Recession and COVID-19, tax cuts are responsible for 90% of the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio.
    - The difference this time is that to pass these tax cuts, Senate Republicans took unprecedented steps to violate the Senate’s own procedures. They think they have the political cover to do so because today’s newscycle is dominated by President Trump’s [tariffs](https://www.salon.com/2025/04/04/tariffs-regime-aims-for-much-bigger-than-a-global-trade/) and their cataclysmic effects on markets rather than arcane topics like legislative processes and budget scoring.
    - And they feel they have do it this way because they know how things are starting to look. They claim to be the party of fiscal conservatism and their leaders bemoan the national debt, but this plan blows up the debt. They ran on lowering costs, but the Trump tariffs [reignite](https://www.wsj.com/video/fed-chair-powell-tariffs-increases-will-lead-to-higher-inflation/79C5BE3B-BFC2-4FA1-BC30-B7D90FCEB7BA) inflation. They have adopted the mantle of working class champions, but they’ve designed a plan to benefit the wealthy and hurt the poor. It’s no surprise why they are trying to hide from their responsibilities.

    - In his quest to make America great, President Donald Trump is withdrawing the United States from global trade. American families, companies, and investors will pay a price for this, as many commentators have noted. But the repercussions don’t end there. The tariff regime is also destroying a pillar of American global power, and it will further isolate the country at a moment when others stand ready to fill the vacuum.
    - On Wednesday, Trump [announced](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-trade-war-stock-market-04-02-2025/card/how-trump-s-new-tariffs-will-impact-countries-differently-jacLhiMw64agnWsIjMbA) that America would impose a 10 percent duty on imports from virtually all countries, plus additional punitive tariffs on countries he deems bad actors on trade, including Japan and members of the European Union. Some of these duties are extremely high. Adding the new levies to those previously imposed, China’s average tariff rate is now near 70 percent. Trump [described](https://rollcall.com/2025/04/02/donald-trump-tariffs-economy-liberation-day/) the tariffs as payback: “Foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream,” he said. “Our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not going to happen anymore.”
    - Trump’s tariffs are the culmination of a decades-long shift in political perceptions in the United States, in which trade has gone from an unalloyed good to the source of all ills. The U.S. once sought to bring down barriers and open markets globally—forging trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, and supporting the World Trade Organization. The resulting global trading system lowered the cost of goods, which benefited the companies and consumers of wealthy countries such as the United States. It also connected poorer countries, such as China, to international supply chains, allowing them to create jobs, woo investment, and alleviate poverty. The United States became, in effect, the world’s ultimate consumer, which tied other countries to its economy and its interests.
    - [Annie Lowrey: Here are the places where the recession has already begun](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/recession-tariffs-canada-trump/682297/)
    - Trade was a glue that held the American-led international order together. But economics always involves trade-offs. As supply chains stretched across the globe in search of lower costs, many factories vanished from the American heartland. Some Americans fastened on trade as the source of the inequality and constrained mobility that plagued the country’s middle and working classes; populist politicians encouraged these sentiments.
    - Strategically, too, trade’s promise seemed unrealized: Experts and politicians had assured Americans after the Cold War that economic exchange would transform China and Russia into peaceful partners. Within a couple of decades, these powers had clearly become authoritarian competitors instead.
    - The Trump team sold its tariffs program as a bid to set things straight by forcing America’s lost factories to return home. “You’re going to see the greatest resurgence of factory building and factory production in America,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick [said](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/cnbc-transcript-united-states-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-speaks-with-cnbcs-squawk-box-today.html?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) in defense of the tariffs. Trump is “changing the way people think about production in America.”
    - The results are unlikely to be what the administration anticipates. Some foreign companies may indeed respond to the tariffs by building factories in the U.S. to maintain their presence in a crucial market. But many others are simply too small, or too integrated into existing supply chains, to make that move. Where the millions of American workers will come from to screw together iPhones or make car parts is also a mystery, especially given the president’s opposition to large-scale immigration. Factories in the U.S. are already struggling to find workers; the manufacturing sector has hundreds of thousands of vacant openings.
    - Trump has long complained that some other countries tilt trade in their own favor. The White House, in [explaining](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-our-sovereignty-and-strengthen-our-national-and-economic-security/) its tariff regime, cited practices by other countries, including currency manipulation and onerous product standards that inhibit imports, that have been real concerns. But the tariff regime may soon lay bare the inconvenient truth of comparative advantage: Certain goods are made outside the U.S. because factories elsewhere can produce them more cheaply and efficiently. Lower costs are a big factor, but so is competence. Many manufacturers in China and elsewhere have developed skills and expertise that make them highly competitive.
    - The likely outcome of Trump’s policy will be high prices for what Americans make and buy, whether produced at home at greater cost than abroad or imported from overseas with a punitive tax. By one [estimate](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-stokes-trade-war-world-reels-tariff-shock-2025-04-03/), tariffs could hike the price of a top-end iPhone to $2,300. The Trump team seems to accept this. “Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent [said](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/06/treasury-secretary-bessent-says-the-american-dream-is-not-about-access-to-cheap-goods.html) in March. But when consumers buy fewer products at higher prices, companies produce and sell less and hire fewer workers, and [growth slows](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/piie-experts-react-trumps-tariffs-announced-april-2). As French President Emmanuel Macron [put it](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20250403-macron-calls-on-europe-to-suspend-investment-in-us-after-trump-tariff-shock), Trump’s policy will make Americans “weaker and poorer.”
    - Americans will not be the only ones to suffer in a global trade war. Other countries will likely respond to U.S. tariffs by erecting protectionist barriers of their own. China has already [announced](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-tariffs-trade-war-04-04-2025/card/china-retaliates-with-34-tariff-on-u-s-goods-3WvyupwMPTPnA8XWy6W9) an additional 34 percent tariff on U.S. imports. The EU is threatening to [retaliate](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/03/eu-preparing-further-countermeasures-to-us-tariffs-if-negotiations-fail-ec-president-von-der-leyen.html) too. The global trade that was once an engine of prosperity may now reverse and become a source of economic competition.
    - Other countries long accepted U.S. leadership because they saw Washington as a proponent of global economic progress. The role Trump is choosing for the United States is not that. He may eventually roll back tariffs for those countries that negotiate with him, and he may even see this as a show of kingpin-like strength: Trump has already [said](https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-says-china-could-get-tariff-relief-if-it-approves-tiktok-deal-2025-04-03/) that he’d be willing to reduce duties on China in return for a deal involving TikTok. But the erratic and arbitrary nature of the policies, and the willingness to exploit U.S. economic might to extort concessions, will undermine American standing nearly everywhere.
    - [Rogé Karma: Trump’s tariffs are designed to backfire](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/trump-tariff-theory-reality/682279/)
    - In fact, the administration’s tariff policy opens opportunities for Beijing, of all players, to portray itself as the more responsible global leader. In a meeting just days before Trump’s announcement, ministers from China, Japan, and South Korea issued a [statement](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-china-japan-agree-promote-regional-trade-trump-tariffs-loom-2025-03-30/) pledging to promote global trade.
    - That two of Washington’s closest allies would join Beijing in implicit criticism of the U.S. highlights the danger. The U.S. remains the world’s largest economy and a key market for many countries’ exports. But it is not the only game in town, either. A social-media account associated with CCTV, a Chinese state broadcaster, posted a graphic showing the extensive trade agreements that America’s partners have with one another and commented that, with the new tariffs, the U.S. is “shutting itself out of the world of free trade.” These countries will continue to expand their economic ties whatever Trump does. During his first term, after Trump withdrew the U.S. from a major trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, participants completed the pact on their own.
    - Tariffs are not going to make other countries respect the United States. But they can make them move on without it.

  - Until January 20, 2025, I didn’t realize how much of my very identity was built on this faith in my country’s goodness—on the idea that we Americans are partners in a grand and heroic enterprise, that our daily lives are ennobled by service to that cause. Since January 20, as I have watched America behave vilely—toward our friends in Canada and Mexico, toward our friends in Europe, [toward the heroes in Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/zelensky-trump-putin-ukraine/681883/) in the Oval Office—I’ve had trouble describing the anguish I’ve experienced. Grief? Shock? Like I’m living through some sort of hallucination? Maybe the best description for what I’m feeling is moral shame: To watch the loss of your nation’s honor is embarrassing and painful.
  - George Orwell is a useful guide to what we’re witnessing. He understood that it is possible for people to seek power without having any vision of the good. “The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake,” an apparatchik says in [_1984_](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780451524935). “We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power.” How is power demonstrated? By making others suffer. Orwell’s character continues: “Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation.”
  - Russell Vought, Donald Trump’s budget director, sounds like he walked straight out of _1984_. “When they wake up in the morning, [we want them to not want to go to work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBH9TmeJN_M&t=12s), because they are increasingly viewed as the villains,” he said of federal workers, speaking at an event in 2023. “We want to put them in trauma.”
  - Since coming back to the White House, Trump has caused suffering among Ukrainians, suffering among immigrants who have lived here for decades, suffering among some of the best people I know. Many of my friends in Washington are evangelical Christians who found their vocation in public service—fighting sex trafficking, serving the world’s poor, protecting America from foreign threats, doing biomedical research to cure disease. They are trying to live lives consistent with the gospel of mercy and love. Trump has devastated their work. He isn’t just declaring war on “wokeness”; he’s declaring war on Christian service—on any kind of service, really.
  - If there is an underlying philosophy driving Trump, it is this: Morality is for suckers. The strong do what they want and the weak suffer what they must. This is the logic of bullies everywhere. And if there is a consistent strategy, it is this: Day after day, the administration works to create a world where ruthless people can thrive. That means destroying any institution or arrangement that might check the strongman’s power. The rule of law, domestic or international, restrains power, so it must be eviscerated. [Inspectors general](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/08/trump-attacks-inspector-general-glenn-fine/679596/), [judge advocate general officers](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/trump-jag-military-lawyers-fired/681888/), [oversight mechanisms](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/03/hampton-dellinger-whistlebower-office-special-counsel/681995/), and watchdog agencies are a potential restraint on power, so they must be fired or neutered. The truth itself is a restraint on power, so it must be abandoned. Lying becomes the language of the state.
  - Trump’s first term was a precondition for his second. His first term gradually eroded norms and acclimatized America to a new sort of regime. This laid the groundwork for his second term, in which he’s making the globe a playground for gangsters.
  - We used to live in a world where ideologies clashed, but ideologies don’t seem to matter anymore. The strongman understanding of power is on the march. Power is like money: the more the better. Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the rest of the world’s authoritarians are forming an axis of ruthlessness before our eyes. Trumpism has become a form of nihilism that is devouring everything in its path.
  - The pathetic thing is that I didn’t see this coming even though I’ve been living around these people my whole adult life. I joined the conservative movement in the 1980s, when I worked in turn at _National Review_, _The Washington Times_, and _The Wall Street Journal_ editorial page. There were two kinds of people in our movement back then, the conservatives and the reactionaries. We conservatives earnestly read Milton Friedman, James Burnham, Whittaker Chambers, and Edmund Burke. The reactionaries just wanted to shock the left. We conservatives oriented our lives around writing for intellectual magazines; the reactionaries were attracted to TV and radio. We were on the political right but had many liberal friends; they had contempt for anyone not on the anti-establishment right. They were not pro-conservative—they were anti-left. I have come to appreciate that this is an important difference.
  - I should have understood this much sooner, because the reactionaries had revealed their true character as far back as January 1986. A group of progressive students at Dartmouth had erected a shantytown on campus to protest apartheid. One night, [a group of 12 students](https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/12/us/dartmouth-suspends-12-for-attack-on-shanties.html), most of them associated with the right-wing _Dartmouth Review_, descended on the shanties with sledgehammers and smashed them down.
  - Even then I was appalled. Apartheid was evil, and worth opposing. A nighttime raid with sledgehammers seemed more Gestapo than Burkean. But conservative intellectuals didn’t take this seriously enough. In large part, I think this was because we looked down on the _Dartmouth Review_ mafia, whose members had included Laura Ingraham and Dinesh D’Souza. Their intellectual standards were so obviously third-rate. I don’t know how to put this politely, but they just seemed creepy—nakedly ambitious in a way that I thought would destroy them in the end.
  - [From the December 2024 issue: David Brooks on how the Ivy League broke America](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/12/meritocracy-college-admissions-social-economic-segregation/680392/)
  - Instead, history has smiled on them. A prominent publisher of right-wing authors once told me that the way to sell conservative books is not to write a good book—it’s to write a book that will offend the left, thereby causing the reactionaries to rally to your side and buy it. That led to books with titles such as _The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left_, and to Ann Coulter’s entire career. Owning the libs became a lucrative strategy.
  - Of course, the left made it easy for them. The left really did purge conservatives from universities and other cultural power centers. The left really did valorize a “meritocratic” caste system that privileged the children of the affluent and screwed the working class. The left really did pontificate to their unenlightened moral inferiors on everything from gender to the environment. The left really did create a stifling orthodoxy that stamped out dissent. If you tell half the country that their voices don’t matter, then the voiceless are going to flip over the table.
  - But although Trump may have campaigned as a MAGA populist, leveraging this working-class resentment to gain power, he governs as a Palm Beach elitist. Trump and Elon Musk are billionaires who went to the University of Pennsylvania. J. D. Vance went to Yale Law School. Pete Hegseth went to Princeton and Harvard. Vivek Ramaswamy went to Yale and Harvard. Stephen Miller went to Duke. Ted Cruz went to Princeton and Harvard. Many of Musk’s DOGE workers, according to _The New York Times_, [come from elite institutions](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html)—Harvard, Princeton, Morgan Stanley, McKinsey, Wharton. These are the Vineyard Vines nihilists, the spiritual descendants of the elite bad boys at the _Dartmouth Review_. This political moment isn’t populists versus elitists; it is, as I’ve written before, like a civil war in a prep school where the sleazy rich kids are taking on the pretentious rich kids.
  - [Derek Thompson: DOGE’s reign of ineptitude](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/musk-terror-reign/681731/)
  - The MAGA elite rode to power on working-class votes, but—trust me, I know some of them—they don’t care about the working class. Trump and his crew could have taken office with actual plans to make life better for working-class Americans. An administration that cared about the working class would seek to address its problems, such as the fact that [the poorest Americans die an average of 10 to 15 years younger than their higher-income counterparts](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4866586/), or that by sixth grade, many of the children in the poorest school districts have [fallen four grade levels behind those in the richest](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/29/upshot/money-race-and-success-how-your-school-district-compares.html). An administration that cared about these people would have offered a bipartisan industrial policy to create working-class jobs.
  - These faux populists have no interest in that. Instead of helping workers, they focus on civil war with their left-wing fellow elites. During Trump’s first months in office, one of their highest priorities has been to destroy the places where they think liberal elites work—the [scientific community](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/02/trump-science-data-gender-dei/681698/), the [foreign-aid community](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/usaid-dismantle-trump-damage/681644/), the [Kennedy Center](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/trump-america-cultural-revolution/681863/), the [Department of Education](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/02/what-does-the-department-of-education-actually-do/681597/), [universities](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/dei-letter-universities-trump/681986/).
  - It turns out that when you mix narcissism and nihilism, you create an acid that corrodes every belief system it touches.
  - This Trumpian cocktail has [eaten away at Christianity](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/01/evangelicals-trump/681450/), a faith oriented around the marginalized. Blessed are the meek. Blessed are the poor in spirit. The poor are closer to God than the rich. Again and again, Jesus explicitly renounced worldly power.
  - [Read: Evangelicals made a bad trade](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/01/evangelicals-trump/681450/)
  - But if Trumpism has a central tenet, it is untrammeled lust for worldly power. In Trumpian circles, many people ostentatiously identify as Christians but don’t talk about Jesus very much; they have crosses on their chest but Nietzsche in their heart—or, to be more precise, a high-school sophomore’s version of Nietzsche.
  - To Nietzsche, all of those Christian pieties about justice, peace, love, and civility are constraints that the weak erect to emasculate the strong. In this view, Nietzscheanism is a morality for winners. It worships the pagan virtues: power, courage, glory, will, self-assertion. The Nietzschean Übermenschen—which Trump and Musk clearly believe themselves to be—offer the promise of domination over those sick sentimentalists who practice compassion.
  - Two decades ago, Michael Gerson, a graduate of Wheaton College, a prominent evangelical institution, [helped George W. Bush start the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief](https://www.devex.com/news/he-came-up-with-the-name-michael-gerson-s-pepfar-legacy-104487), which has [saved 25 million lives](https://www.state.gov/results-and-impact-pepfar) in Africa and elsewhere. I traveled with Gerson to Namibia, Mozambique, and South Africa, where dying people had recovered and returned to their families, and were leading active lives. It was a proud moment to be an American. Vought—Trump’s budget director, who also graduated from Wheaton—[championed the evisceration of PEPFAR](https://x.com/russvought/status/1765796560615456900?lang=ar), which has now been set in motion by executive order, [effectively sentencing thousands to death](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/ANNALS-24-01104?journalCode=aim). Project 2025, of which Vought [was a principal architect](https://www.propublica.org/article/video-donald-trump-russ-vought-center-renewing-america-maga), helped lay the groundwork for [the dismantling of USAID](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-09.pdf); its gutting appears to have ended a program to supply malaria protection to 53 million people and [cut emergency food packages](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/health/usaid-contract-terminations.html) for starving children. Twenty years is a short time in which to have traveled the long moral distance from Gerson to Vought.
  - [From the April 2018 issue: Michael Gerson on Trump and the evangelical temptation](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/the-last-temptation/554066/)
  - Trumpian nihilism has eviscerated conservatism. The people in this administration are not conservatives. They are the opposite of conservatives. Conservatives once believed in steady but incremental reform; [Elon Musk believes in rash and instantaneous disruption](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/doge-musk-catastrophic-risk/682011/). Conservatives once believed that moral norms restrain and civilize us, habituating us to virtue; Trumpism trashes moral norms in every direction, riding forward on a tide of adultery, abuse, [cruelty](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/trump-campaign-cruelty/680498/), immaturity, grift, and corruption. Conservatives once believed in constitutional government and the Madisonian separation of powers; Trump [bulldozes checks and balances](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1890831570535055759), declaiming on social media, “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” Reagan promoted democracy abroad because he thought it the political system most consistent with human dignity; the Trump administration couldn’t care less about promoting democracy—or about human dignity.
  - How does this end? Will anyone on the right finally stand up to the Trumpian onslaught? Will our institutions withstand the nihilist assault? Is America on the verge of ruin?
  - In February, about a month into Trump’s second term, I [spoke at a gathering of conservatives in London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSa52TR9tCA) called the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship. Some of the speakers were pure populist (Vivek Ramaswamy, Mike Johnson, and Nigel Farage). But others were center-right or not neatly ideological (Niall Ferguson, Bishop Robert Barron, and my _Atlantic_ colleague Arthur C. Brooks).
  - [David Brooks: Confessions of a Republican exile](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/10/trumpism-republican-party-exile-david-brooks/680243/)
  - In some ways, it was like the conservative conferences I’ve been attending for decades. I listened to a woman from Senegal talking about trying to make her country’s culture more entrepreneurial. I met the head of a charter school in the Bronx that focuses on character formation. But in other ways, this conference was startlingly different.
  - In my own talk, I sympathized with the populist critique of what has gone wrong in Western societies. But I shared with the audience my dark view of President Trump. Unsurprisingly, a large segment of the audience booed vigorously. One man screamed that I was a traitor and stormed out. But many other people cheered. Even in conservative precincts infected by reactionary MAGA-ism, some people are evidently tired of Trumpian brutality.
  - As the conference went on, I noticed a contest of metaphors. The true conservatives used metaphors of growth or spiritual recovery. Society is an organism that needs healing, or it is a social fabric that needs to be rewoven. A poet named Joshua Luke Smith [said we needed to be the seeds of regrowth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsiB9uCMZ68), to plant the trees for future generations. His incantation was beatitudinal: “Remember the poor. Remember the poor.”
  - But others relied on military metaphors. We are in the midst of civilizational war. “They”—the wokesters, the radical Muslims, the left—are destroying our culture. There were allusions to the final epochal battles in _The Lord of the Rings_. The implication was that Sauron is leading his Orc hordes to destroy us. We are the heroic remnant. We must crush or be crushed.
  - The warriors tend to think people like me are soft and naive. I tend to think they are catastrophizing narcissists. When I look at Trump acolytes, I see a swarm of Neville Chamberlains who think they’re Winston Churchill.
  - I understand the seductive power of a demagogue who tells you that the people who look down on you are evil. I understand the seductive power of being told that your civilization is on the verge of total collapse, and that everything around you is degeneracy and ruin. This message gives you a kind of terrifying thrill: The stakes are apocalyptic. Your life has meaning and urgency. Everything is broken; let’s burn it all down.
  - I understand why people who feel alienated would want to follow the leader who speaks about domination and combat, not the one who speaks about healing and cooperation. It doesn’t matter how many times you’ve read Edmund Burke or the Gospel of Matthew—it’s still tempting to throw away all of your beliefs to support the leader who promises to be “your retribution.”
  - America may well enter a period of democratic decay and international isolation. It takes decades to develop strong alliances, and to build the structures and customs of democracy—and only weeks to decimate them, as we’ve now seen. And yet I find myself confident that America will survive this crisis. Many nations, including our own, have gone through worse and bloodier crises and recovered. In [_Upheaval: Turning Points for Nations in Crisis_](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780316409148), the historian and scientist Jared Diamond provides case studies—Japan in the late 19th century, Finland and Germany after World War II, Indonesia after the 1960s, Chile and Australia during and after the ’70s—of countries that came back stronger after crisis, collapse, or defeat. To these examples, I’d add Britain in the 1830s and ’40s, and the 1980s, and South Korea in the 1980s. Some of these countries (such as Japan) endured war; others (Chile) endured mass torture and “disappearances”; still others (Britain and Australia) endured social decay and national decline. All of them eventually healed and came back.
  - America itself has already been through numerous periods of rupture and repair. Some people think we’re living through a period of unprecedented tumult, but the Civil War and the Great Depression were much worse. So were the late 1960s—assassinations, riots, a failed war, surging crime rates, a society coming apart. From January 1969 until April 1970, there were [4,330 bombings in the U.S., or about nine a day](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Riots_Civil_and_Criminal_Disorders/jMZEAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA5341). But by the 1980s and ’90s—after getting through Watergate, stagflation, and the Carter-era “malaise” of the ’70s—we had recovered. As brutal and disruptive as the tumult of the late 1960s was, it helped the country shake off some of its persistent racism and sexism, and made possible a freer and more individualistic ethos.
  - But the most salient historical parallel might be the America of the 1830s. Andrew Jackson is the American president who most resembles Trump—power-hungry, rash, narcissistic, driven by animosity. He was known by his opponents as “King Andrew” for his expansions of executive power. “The man we have made our President has made himself our despot, and the Constitution now lies a heap of ruins at his feet,” [Senator Asher Robbins of Rhode Island said](https://archive.org/details/trumpetsofgloryf0000hawk/page/160/mode/2up). “When the way to his object lies through the Constitution, the Constitution has not the strength of a cobweb to restrain him from breaking through it.” Jackson brazenly defied the Supreme Court on a ruling about Cherokee Nation territory (a defiance, it should be noted, that [Vice President Vance has explicitly endorsed](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/us/politics/jd-vance-donald-trump-2024-campaign.html)). “Though we live under the form of a republic,” [Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story wrote](https://archive.org/details/lifelettersofjos0002will/page/154/mode/2up), “we are in fact under the absolute rule of a single man.”
  - But Jackson made the classic mistake of the populist: He overreached. Fueled by personal hostility toward elites, he destroyed the Second Bank of the United States, an early precursor to the Federal Reserve System, and helped spark an economic depression that ruined the administration of his chosen successor, Martin Van Buren.
  - ![illustration with top half of a torn portrait of Andrew Jackson's superimposed over the bottom half of a portrait of Donald Trump](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/zxIvhOs453Ljco0DRTPefFso8d0=/0x0:1375x1562/655x744/media/img/posts/2025/03/WEL_Brooks_ConservatismSpot/original.png)
  - Illustration by Ricardo Tomás. Sources: Heritage Images / Getty; Win McNamee / AFP / Getty.
  - In response to Jackson, the Whig Party arose in the 1830s to create a new political and social order. Devoutly anti-authoritarian, the Whigs were a cultural, civic, and political force all at once. They emphasized both traditional morality and progressive improvements. They agitated for prison reform and for keeping the Sabbath, for more women’s participation in politics and for a strong military, for government-funded public schools and for pro-business government policies. They were opposed to Jackson’s monstrous Indian Removal Act, and to the Democratic Party’s reactionary, white-supremacist social vision. Whereas Jacksonian Democrats emphasized negative liberty—_get your hands off me_—the Whigs, who would turn into the early Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln, emphasized positive liberty, empowering Americans to live bigger, better lives with things such as expanded economic credit, free public education, and stronger legal protections including due process and property rights.
  - Though we’ve come to call the early-to-mid-19th century the Age of Jackson, [the historian Daniel Walker Howe notes](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780195392432) that it was not Jackson but the Whigs who created the America we know today. “As economic modernizers, as supporters of strong national government, and as humanitarians more receptive than their rivals to talent regardless of race and gender,” Howe writes, the Whigs “facilitated the transformation of the United States from a collection of parochial agricultural communities into a cosmopolitan nation integrated by commerce, industry, information, and voluntary associations as well as by political ties.” Looking back, Howe concludes, we can see that even though they were not the dominant party of their time, the Whigs “were the party of America’s future.” To begin its recovery from Trumpism, America needs its next Whig moment.
  - Yes, we have reached a point of traumatic rupture. A demagogue has come to power and is ripping everything down. But what’s likely to happen is that the demagogue will start making mistakes, because incompetence is built into the nihilistic project. Nihilists can only destroy, not build. Authoritarian nihilism is inherently stupid. I don’t mean that Trumpists have low IQs. I mean they do things that run directly against their own interests. They are pathologically self-destructive. When you create an administration in which one man has all the power and everybody else has to flatter his voracious ego, stupidity results. Authoritarians are also morally stupid. Humility, prudence, and honesty are not just nice virtues to have—they are practical tools that produce good outcomes. When you replace them with greed, lust, hypocrisy, and dishonesty, terrible things happen.
  - [From the September 2023 issue: David Brooks on why Americans are so awful to one another](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/us-culture-moral-education-formation/674765/)
  - The DOGE children are doubtless brilliant in certain ways, but they know as much about government as I know about rocketry. They announced an $8 billion cut to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract—though [if they had read their own documents correctly](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/upshot/doge-contracts-musk-trump.html), they would have realized that the cut was less than $8 _million_. They eliminated workers from the National Nuclear Security Administration, apparently [without realizing that this agency controls nuclear security](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/02/doge-nuclear-worker-firings-musk-trump/), and had to undo some of those cuts shortly thereafter. Trump seems to be trying to give a bunch of Sam Bankman-Frieds access to America’s nuclear arsenal and IRS records. What could go wrong?
  - When Trump creates an unnecessary crisis, it’s unlikely to be a small one. The proverbial “adults in the room” who contained crises in Trump’s first term are gone. Whatever the second-term crisis—runaway inflation? a global trade war? a cratered economy and plummeting stock market? an out-of-control conflict in China? botched pandemic management? a true hijacking of the Constitution precipitated by defiance of the courts?—it is likely to crater his support and shift historical momentum.
  - But although Trumpism’s collapse is a necessary condition for national recovery, it is not a sufficient one. Its demise must be followed by the hard work necessary to achieve true civic and political renewal.
  - Progress is not always a smooth or merry ride. For a few decades, nations live according to one paradigm. Then it stops working and gets destroyed. When the time comes to build a new paradigm, progressives talk about economic redistribution; conservatives talk about cultural and civic repair. History shows that you need both: Recovery from national crisis demands comprehensive reinvention at all levels of society. If you look back across the centuries, you find that this process requires several interconnected efforts.
  - First, a national shift in values. In the late 19th century, for example, as the country went through the wrenching process of industrialization, America was traumatized by severe recessions and mass urban poverty. In response, social Darwinism gave way to the social-gospel movement. Social Darwinism, associated with thinkers such as Herbert Spencer, valorized survival of the fittest and claimed that the poor are poor because of inferior abilities. The social-gospel movement, associated with theologians such as Walter Rauschenbusch, emphasized the systemic causes of poverty, including the Gilded Age’s concentration of corporate power. By the early 20th century, most mainline Protestant denominations had [signed on to the Social Creed of the Churches](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Social_Creed_of_the_Churches/tHcAAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0), which called for, among other things, the abolition of child labor and the creation of disability insurance.
  - Second, nations that hang together through crisis have a strong national identity—they return to their roots. They have a leader who replaces the amoralism of the nihilists, or, say, the immorality of slavery, with a strong redefinition of the nation’s moral mission, the way Lincoln redefined America at Gettysburg.
  - Third, a civic renaissance. After the social gospel took root, Americans in the 1890s and early 1900s launched and participated in a series of social movements and civic organizations: United Way, the NAACP, the Sierra Club, the settlement-house movement, the American Legion.
  - Fourth, a national reassessment. As Jared Diamond notes, nations that turn around don’t catastrophize. Rather, they develop a clear-eyed view of what’s working and not working, and they pursue careful, selective change. According to Diamond’s research, the leaders of successful reform movements also take responsibility for their part in the crisis. For instance, Germany’s leaders accepted responsibility for the country’s Nazi past; Finland’s leaders took responsibility for an unrealistic foreign policy before World War II, when they had to deal with a looming Soviet Union on their border; and Australia’s leaders took responsibility in the 1970s for a political culture and foreign policy that had become overly dependent on Britain.
  - Fifth, a surge of political reform. In 1830s and ’40s Britain—racked by social chaos, bank failures, a severe depression, riots, and crushing wealth inequality—Prime Minister Robert Peel, a leader of great moral rectitude, built the modern police force, reduced tariffs, pushed railway legislation that literally laid the tracks for British industrialization, and helped pass the Factory Act of 1844, which regulated workplaces. In early-20th-century America, Progressives produced a comparable flurry of effective reforms that pulled the country out of its industrialization crisis.
  - Part of political reform is an expansion of the circle of power. What that would require in America today is, among other things, a broad effort to include working-class and conservative voices in what have traditionally been cultural bastions of elite progressivism—universities, the nonprofit sector, the civil service, the mainstream media.
  - [Derek Thompson: Abundance can be America’s next political order](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/abundance-americas-next-political-order/682069/)
  - Finally, economic expansion. Economic growth can salve many wounds. Pursuing [a so-called abundance agenda](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781668023488)—a set of policies aimed at reducing government regulation and increasing investment in innovation, and expanding the supply of housing, energy, and health care—is the [most promising way](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/abundance-americas-next-political-order/682069/) to achieve that expansion.
  - in the long term, Trumpism is doomed. Power without prudence and humility invariably fails. Nations, like people, change not when times are good but in response to pain. At a moment when Trumpism seems to be devouring everything, the temptation is to believe that this time is different.
  - But history doesn’t stop moving. Even now, as I travel around the country, I see the forces of repair gathering in neighborhoods and communities. If you’re part of an organization that builds trust across class, you’re fighting Trumpism. If you’re a Democrat jettisoning insular faculty-lounge progressivism in favor of a Whig-like working-class abundance agenda, you’re fighting Trumpism. If you are standing up for a moral code of tolerance and pluralism that can hold America together, you’re fighting Trumpism.
  - Over time, changes in values lead to changes in relationships, which lead to changes in civic life, which eventually lead to changes in policy and then in the general trajectory of the nation. It starts slow, but as the Book of Job says, the sparks will fly upward.

  - After the war, Baker became a prominent and outspoken US civil rights campaigner, famously speaking with Martin Luther King Jr at the 1963 March on Washington and adopting 12 children from eight countries to live with her in her chateau in the Dordogne.

  - During it, she was a spy. Shrouded in the fog of war, then recounted afterwards – often unreliably – in the memoirs of people (including Baker herself) with a story to spin, the entertainer’s wartime exploits have long been a subject for speculation and mythmaking.
  - But a new account, working from contemporary, often unused sources, has uncovered evidence that Baker was not only a highly effective agent but was also using the same celebrity that provided the perfect cover for her espionage as a powerful means to promote the cause of equal rights.
  - “Looking at her life through the prism of the war really helps us understand who she was, and to make sense of what she did later on,” said Hanna Diamond, a professor of French history at Cardiff University and the author of [Josephine Baker’s Secret War](https://yalebooks.co.uk/book/9780300279986/josephine-bakers-secret-war/), which is published on Tuesday.
  - “The war was so important; it’s the missing piece of her puzzle. She \[Baker\] was amazingly well equipped to be a spy; a performer, through and through. Her motivation came from the huge debt she felt to [France](https://www.theguardian.com/world/france), which had made her a star – and it had its roots in the racism she grew up with.”
  - ![Josephine Baker is accompanied by a uniformed army orchestra](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5df7a8b48e0fac038a52c7c22a67e994f7d87d19/0_90_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)

  - Born in 1906 in St Louis, Missouri, Baker left school at 12 and in 1921 was cast in an early all-Black musical on Broadway. Four years later, she won a place in a Paris show, La Revue Nègre, and set sail for France. She swiftly became a huge star.
  - By 1939, when she was recruited by Jacques Abtey, an initially sceptical French intelligence agent who would become her handler and on-off lover, Baker was Europe’s highest paid entertainer and one of its best-known female celebrities.
  - Abtey taught her the tricks of the spy trade, such as using invisible ink, but it was Baker’s far-reaching fame – which meant everyone, everywhere wanted to meet her – and easy charm (which ensured they also talked freely) that were her real espionage assets.
  - From early 1941, Baker, under the aegis of the French secret services, travelled from Marrakech, where she was based, to Lisbon, Madrid, Seville and Barcelona, and round north Africa, giving concerts, attending receptions – and gathering and passing top secret information to allied agents.
  - ![Josephine Baker receives the Légion d’honneur and Croix de guerre in 1961](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e99a0b90baad0c6769138fa540b6192dbd9f70a/0_0_5616_3885/master/5616.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)
  - Josephine Baker receives the Légion d’honneur and Croix de guerre in 1961. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images
  - She proved expert enough at it to be awarded, after the war, the resistance medal and, belatedly, the Légion d’honneur with the military Croix de guerre.
  - Although precisely what was in the notes that she carried – often pinned to her bra – was, in many cases, officially unrecorded and remains unknown, Diamond’s research suggests that on several occasions it proved hugely valuable, and was sometimes critical.
  - Previously unused sources show, for example, that after the allied landings in north Africa in 1942, Baker and the local leaders she had cultivated played a crucial role aiding US counter-intelligence in Morocco, identifying Nazi spies and allowing hundreds of arrests.
  - “We now know she continued as a key intermediary between the French, Americans and Moroccans through 1943 and 1944,” Diamond said. “We’ve long known a little about her allied spying activities. But this role as a vital go-between is new.”
  - ![Josephine Baker in a villa in Algiers in the presence of Gen Bouscat during the youth air festival in 1944](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ec6dcfe76fe5711bdb53d5b148cf89f3bdabe2a/0_128_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)
  - Josephine Baker performed in north Africa for allied troops, including unsegregated US military personnel. Photograph: © Jean Tourtois/ECPAD/Defense
  - Similarly, contemporary sources show Baker’s well-documented postwar anti-racism campaign was already under way in the early 1940s. Her tours of US army camps across north Africa brought her face to face with the racial segregation she had left behind in 1925.
  - Press interviews from the time make her motivations for performing very clear: “I am doing all I can to help win the war effort,” she told the Chicago Defender in 1943, but also “to make people generally more appreciative and kinder to my race”.
  - Gaining acceptance from the troops for whom she was singing and dancing was about promoting racial tolerance at home, Baker told the Palestine Post that same year: “Every success that I have counts for my coloured brothers in America.”
  - In north Africa, Baker performed, unusually, for audiences of unsegregated US troops. Playing to British forces, she was also subject to ugly racist remarks, apparently from South African troops, UK armed forces entertainments officer Henry Hurford Janes recorded.
  - The question was existential, Diamond said. “Discrimination was behind her decision to stay in France. In Paris, she had distanced herself from the other African-American exiles. She wanted to be French and when the war came, unlike others who left France, she stayed to support her compatriots.”
  - ![Josephine Baker dances with her husband, Jean Lion, at the Porte de Versailles in Paris in 1937](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c6ac8b2251b1af2e9e42801862930e949bd7541/0_0_2227_1335/master/2227.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)
  - Josephine Baker dances with her husband, Jean Lion, at the Porte de Versailles in Paris in 1937. Photograph: AP
  - Baker refused to perform in occupied Paris, however, moving to the Dordogne days before the Germans arrived and, later, on to Vichy-controlled Morocco. Her 1937 marriage to Jean Lion, which made her a French citizen, reinforced her views. Lion was Jewish and Baker helped his family escape the Germans. “She knew very well, at first-hand, what Nazi racism meant,” Diamond said.
  - By contrast, her ardent Gaullism – she corresponded frequently with the general long after the end of the war, the book reveals – and idealisation of France meant she kept largely quiet when its north African colonies strived for independence.
  - In 2021, Emmanuel Macron decided [Baker should become the first Black woman to enter the Panthéon in Paris](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/28/dancer-singer-spy-frances-pantheon-to-honour-josephine-baker), the mausoleum for France’s “great men”. The French president referenced her wartime activities – which were a revelation to many.
  - “In France,” Diamond said, “she is mainly known as a music-hall star, and in the US as a civil rights activist.” A whole chapter – the spying missions, the concerts that raised large sums for the resistance, her subsequent uniformed service in the French air force – was far less familiar.
  - ![Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech with a large portrait of Josephine Baker in military uniform in the background](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e8c62d0c450e6c109165ca98d0c6dbe68b447f7/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)

  - Having begun her research “somewhat sceptical”, Diamond said she finished it “convinced Baker actually was really very valuable. She may not always have known what she was transmitting, but she did what she was told, and she did her best.”
  - The picture that emerges, Diamond said, is of “an incredibly able, shrewd, committed” Black woman who “saw very clearly that she could exploit her celebrity for a cause and, often with very great courage, then just went ahead and did so”.
  - During the war, Baker mobilised her talent as a performer, on and off stage, for Free France. After it, she applied what she had learned, effectively harnessing her celebrity to protest against the racial segregation policies of her native country.
  - “Knowing more about her wartime experiences helps us see how she herself came to understand what she could achieve,” Diamond said. “It was the war – the intelligence work and the performing – that made her aware of her power.”

Charlotte

I don't know how to say how much your hospitality meant to me yesterday. Vinaka. Mahalo. thank you from the bottom of my heart. Tell Luisa, thank you for her gift of the fan. I hope things go well with your husbands tests and doctor's appointment. A friend from church who had been a practicing Jew in his youth told me that good friends don’t say "shalom" but rather "l’hitraot", meaning "until we meet again". I prefer shalom because it has deep meanings of peace. But I also like the thought of "til we meet again" because it means we are good friends, you and I, and we shall meet again. Thank you.

    - # ‘A case study in groupthink’: were liberals wrong about the pandemic? | US politics | The Guardian
    - Were conservatives right to question [Covid](https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak) lockdowns? Were the liberals who defended them less grounded in science than they believed? And did liberal dismissiveness of the other side come at a cost that Americans will continue to pay for many years?
    - A new book by two political scientists argues yes to all three questions, making the case that the aggressive policies that the US and other countries adopted to fight Covid – including school shutdowns, business closures, mask mandates and social distancing – were in some cases misguided and in many cases deserved more rigorous public debate.
    - In their peer-reviewed [book](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691267135/in-covids-wake?srsltid=AfmBOoopaXYBoFaN7vkJJJs4dhGEE5V5A72kVtB6tc922n18MduioePN), In Covid’s Wake: How Our Politics Failed Us, Stephen Macedo and Frances Lee argue that public health authorities, the mainstream media, and progressive elites often pushed pandemic measures without weighing their costs and benefits, and ostracized people who expressed good-faith disagreement.
    - ![a book cover with a photo of a sign on a highway reading ‘closed due to covid-19’](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2cd2b233cdd8463579c34d0c17d5f1c64164ef2/0_0_1875_2850/master/1875.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)
    - The book cover of In Covid’s Wake: How Our Politics Failed Us. Photograph: Princeton University Press
    - “Policy learning seemed to be short-circuited during the pandemic,” Lee said. “It became so moralized, like: ‘We’re not interested in looking at how other people are \[responding to the pandemic\], because only bad people would do it a different way from the way we’re doing’.”
    - She and Macedo spoke to the Guardian by video call. The [Princeton University](https://www.theguardian.com/education/princeton-university) professors both consider themselves left-leaning, and the book grew out of research Macedo was doing on the ways progressive discourse gets handicapped by a refusal to engage with conservative or outside arguments. “Covid is an amazing case study in groupthink and the effects of partisan bias,” he said.
    - Many Covid stances presented as public health consensus were not as grounded in empirical evidence as many Americans may have believed, Macedo and Lee argue. At times, scientific and health authorities acted less like neutral experts and [more like](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/opinion/covid-pandemic-lab-leak.html) self-interested actors, engaging in PR efforts to downplay uncertainty, missteps or conflicts of interest.
    - It’s a controversial argument. Covid-19 killed more than a million Americans, [according](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_deaths-total) to US government estimates. The early days of the pandemic left hospitals overwhelmed, morgues overflowing, and scientists scrambling to understand the new disease and how to contain it.
    - Still, Macedo and Lee say, it is unclear why shutdowns and closures went on so long, particularly in [Democratic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats) states. The book argues that in the US the pandemic became more politically polarized over time, after, initially, “only modest policy differences between [Republican](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans)\- and Democratic-leaning states”.
    - After April 2020, however, red and blue America diverged. [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) contributed to that polarization by [downplaying](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/21/837348551/timeline-what-trump-has-said-and-done-about-the-coronavirus) the severity of the virus. Significant policy differences also emerged. Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida, moved to re-open physical schools quickly, which progressives characterized as irresponsible.
    - Yet in the end there was “no meaningful difference” in Covid mortality rates between Democratic and Republican states in the pre-vaccine period, according to CDC data cited in the book, despite Republican states’ more lenient policies. Macedo and Lee also favorably compare Sweden, which controversially avoided mass lockdowns but [ultimately](https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/34/4/737/7675929) had a lower mortality rate than many other European countries.
    - The shutdowns had foreseeable and quantifiable costs, they say, many of which we are still paying. [Learning loss](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/briefing/covid-learning-losses.html) and [school absenteeism](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/parents-are-not-fully-aware-of-or-concerned-about-their-childrens-school-attendance/) soared. Inflation went through the roof thanks in part to lockdown spending and stimulus payments. Small businesses defaulted; other medical treatments like cancer screenings and [mental health care](https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-covid-19-pandemic-triggers-25-increase-in-prevalence-of-anxiety-and-depression-worldwide) suffered; and rates of loneliness and [crime](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/upshot/murder-decline-pandemic-cities.html) increased. The economic strain on poor and minority Americans was particularly severe.
    - Covid policies escalated into culture wars, amplifying tensions around other social issues. Teachers’ unions, which are often bastions of Democratic support, painted school re-openings as “rooted in sexism, racism, and misogyny” and “a recipe for … structural racism”, the book notes, despite the fact that minority and poor students were most [disadvantaged](https://jsri.msu.edu/publications/nexo/vol-xxiv/no-2-spring-2021/racial-ethnic-differences-in-education-disruptions-during-the-covid-19-pandemic) by remote learning.
    - These measures also had a literal price. “In inflation-adjusted terms,” Macedo and Lee write, “the United States spent more on pandemic aid in 2020 than it spent on the 2009 stimulus package and the New Deal combined” – or about what the US spent on war production in 1943.
    - ![a child playing a cello inside her home](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2688e225dd68e0d889982549285527ac6ec75496/0_0_5100_3417/master/5100.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)
    - A student listens to her music teacher over laptop during a lockdown on 5 April 2020 in New York City. Photograph: Education Images/Universal Images Group/Getty Images
    - Yet of the $5tn that the [US Congress](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress) authorized in 2020 and 2021 for Covid expenditure, only about 10% went to direct medical expenses such as hospitals or vaccine distribution, according to the book; most of the spending was on economic relief to people and businesses affected by shutdowns. Ten per cent of that relief was [stolen](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/2023/the-great-grift/) by fraud, according to the AP.
    - The pandemic was an emergency with no modern precedent, of course, and hindsight is easy. But In Covid’s Wake tries to take into account what information was known at the time – including earlier pandemic preparedness studies. Reports by [Johns Hopkins](https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/sites/default/files/2023-02/190918-gmpbreport-respiratorypathogen.pdf) (2019), the [World Health Organization](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf?sequence=1) (2019), [the state of Illinois](https://dph.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/idph/files/publications/illinois-pandemic-flu-plan-050316.pdf) (2014) and the [British government](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7c4767e5274a2041cf2ee3/dh_131040.pdf) (2011) had all expressed ambivalence or caution about the kind of quarantine measures that were soon taken.
    - “We take a look at the state of the evidence as it was in early 2020,” Lee said. “It was clear at the time that the evidence was quite unsettled around all of this, and if policymakers had been more honest with the public about these uncertainties, I think they would have maintained public trust better.”
    - The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security hosted a wargaming exercise in October 2019, shortly before the pandemic began, to simulate a deadly [coronavirus](https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/tabletop-exercises/event-201-pandemic-tabletop-exercise#scenario) pandemic; the [findings](https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/sites/default/files/2022-12/200117-publicprivatepandemiccalltoaction.pdf) explicitly urged that “\[t\]ravel and trade … be maintained even in the face of a pandemic”. Similarly, a WHO paper in 2019 said that some measures – such as border closures and contact tracing – were “not recommended in any circumstances”.
    - “And yet we did all of that in short order,” Macedo said, “and without people referring back to these plans.”
    - He and Lee also believe there was a strong element of class bias, with a left-leaning “laptop class” that could easily work from home touting anti-Covid measures that were much easier for some Americans to adopt than others. Many relatively affluent Americans became even [wealthier](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/american-income-wealth-surged-pandemic-federal-reserve/) during the pandemic, in part due to rising housing values.
    - At the same time, the laptop class was only able to socially isolate at home in part because other people risked exposure to provide groceries. Stay-at-home measures were partly intended to protect “essential workers”, but policymakers living in crisis-stricken major metropolitan areas such as New York or Washington DC did not reckon with why social distancing and other measures might be less important in rural parts of the country where Covid rates were lower.
    - Lockdowns were intended to slow Covid’s spread, yet previous pandemic recommendations had suggested they only be used very early in an outbreak and even then do not buy much time, Macedo said.
    - ![two people stand next to each other smiling ](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42e93bcca1f4fec173e7e153e13f034d02aab919/0_1331_3024_2701/master/3024.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)
    - Stephen Macedo and Frances Lee. Photograph: Courtesy of Stephen Macedo
    - Policymakers and experts often embraced stringent measures for reasons that are more political than medical, Macedo and Lee argue; in a pandemic, authorities are keen to assure anxious publics that they are “in charge” and “doing something”.
    - In strange contrast, policymakers and journalists in the US and elsewhere seemed to take China as a model, the book argues, despite the fact that China is an authoritarian state and had concealed the scale of the outbreak during the crucial early days of the pandemic. Its regime had obvious incentives to mislead foreign observers, and used draconian quarantine measures such as physically welding people into their homes.
    - When the WHO organized a joint China field mission with the Chinese government, in February 2020, non-Chinese researchers found it difficult to converse with their Chinese counterparts away from government handlers. Yet the WHO’s [report](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/report-of-the-who-china-joint-mission-on-coronavirus-disease-2019-/(covid-19/)) was “effusive in its praise” of China’s approach, the book notes.
    - “My view is that there was just a great deal of wishful thinking on the part of technocrats of all kinds,” Lee said. “They wanted there to be an answer – that if we do X and Y, we can prevent this disaster. And so they’re kind of grasping at straws. The Chinese example gave them hope.” She noted that Covid policymakers might have been better served if there had been people [assigned](https://x.com/smarterparrot/status/1898883545109508236) to act as [devil’s advocates](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/18/covid-inquiry-hallett-prescribes-red-teams-as-antidote-to-flawed-thinking) in internal deliberations.
    - Lee and Macedo are not natural scientists or public health professionals, they emphasize, and their book is about failures in public deliberation over Covid-19, rather than a prescription for managing pandemics.
    - But they do wade into the debate about Covid-19’s origin, arguing that the “lab leak” hypothesis – that Covid-19 accidentally leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, rather than spontaneously leaping from animals to humans – was unfairly dismissed.
    - The Wuhan Institute studied coronaviruses similar to the one responsible for Covid-19, had a documented history of safety breaches, was located near the outbreak, and is known to have experimented on viruses using [controversial](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7128689/) [“gain-of-function”](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/coronavirus-lab-escape-theory.html) methods funded by the US, which involve mutating pathogens to see what they might look like in a more advanced or dangerous form.
    - Perhaps because Trump had fanned racial paranoia by calling Covid-19 the “[China virus](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates)” and [rightwing influencers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/america-far-right-coronavirus-outbreak-trump-alex-jones) were spreading the notion that it had been deliberately engineered and unleashed on the world by China, many scientists, public health experts and [journalists](https://www.slowboring.com/p/the-medias-lab-leak-fiasco?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=twitter) reacted by [framing](https://www.thewrap.com/new-york-times-covid-lab-leak-apoorva-mandavilli/) the idea of a lab leak – even an accidental one – as an offensive conspiracy theory. Dr Anthony Fauci and other top public health figures were evasive or in some cases dishonest about the possibility of a lab leak, Macedo and Lee say, as well as the fact that a US non-profit funded by the National Institutes of Health allegedly [funded](https://theintercept.com/2021/09/09/covid-origins-gain-of-function-research/) gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute.
    - Since then, though, the CIA and other US intelligence agencies have cautiously [endorsed](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/26/cia-now-backs-lab-leak-theory-to-explain-origins-of-covid-19) the lab leak theory, and the discourse around Covid has softened somewhat. The economist Emily Oster sparked immense backlash by [arguing](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/schools-arent-superspreaders/616669/) against school closures in 2020. Now publications such as New York Magazine and the New York Times have [acknowledged](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/03/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html) the plausibility of the lab leak hypothesis, for example, and there is growing consensus that school closures hurt many children.
    - The reception to In Covid’s Wake has been [more](https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-coronavirus-consensus-was-wrong) [positive](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/09/opinion/covid-five-year-anniversary-2020-mistakes/) than Macedo and Lee expected – perhaps a sign that some of their arguments have penetrated the mainstream, if not that we’ve gotten better as a society at talking about difficult things. “The reception of the book has been much less controversial \[and\] contentious than we expected,” Macedo said.
    - Yet the wounds fester and debates continue. Some [readers](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/podcasts/the-daily/were-the-covid-lockdowns-worth-it.html#commentsContainer) of the New York Times were furious when The Daily, the newspaper’s flagship podcast, recently interviewed them, with subscribers arguing that the episode was not sufficiently critical of their stance. And some coverage of the book has [criticized](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/laptopclassbook/) it for underplaying the danger of the disease.
    - Macedo and Lee said that a few of their colleagues have expressed concern that their critique could fuel political attacks on science – a worry that crossed their minds too. “Our response is that the best way to refute criticisms that science and universities have been politicized is to be open to criticism and willing to engage in self-criticism,” Macedo said.
    - “We need to make sure these institutions are in the best possible working order to face the challenges ahead. And we think that’s by being honest, not by covering over mistakes or being unwilling to face up to hard questions.”

    - **Ecosystems which have never been seen before are being accidentally created by humans. They offer a stark look into the nature of tomorrow.**
    - Venture deep into the forests on O'ahu, Hawaii's third largest island, and you'll find yourself threading through a dense understory of richly scented pepper, cinnamon and guava trees.
    - "It's beautiful," says Corey Tarwater, an ecologist at the University of Wyoming in the US who began researching O'ahu's ecosystems in 2014. Sounds like the "cheww-chewww" song of the pale green warbling white-eye and the chattering, almost electrical call of the red-billed leiothrix surround you. "There's really neat lizards around," adds Tarwater. "There's these highly structured forests with these amazing tropical plant species."
    - For hikers setting out on O'ahu's mountain trails, these are thrilling wildernesses within easy reach of Hawaii's capital, Honolulu, says Tarwater. Yet nothing is quite as it might seem, she adds. "You wouldn't know unless you study them, but if you walk around any forest around Honolulu, there's not going to be one single native plant species there."
    - If you removed all people from the planet, Hawaii would be on a different evolutionary ecological trajectory going forward – Jens-Christian Svenning
    - O'ahu's mountainous terrain – a filming location that has evoked heroic, untrammelled wildernesses in the Jurassic Park and King Kong films – is shaped "at every level" by human action, says Jef Vizentin-Bugoni, a Brazilian ecologist at Universidade Federal de Pelota who researched the island's birds with Tarwater. He recalls having his expectations upturned when he arrived on the island in 2017, eager to see Hawaii's famous honeycreepers, a set of brightly coloured [native bird species that exist](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211010785) nowhere else in the world. Instead, he was first confronted with an unfamiliar flurry of red and white feathers, which turned out to be a red-whiskered bulbul, a bird whose [native range spans from India to Southern China](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/hisc/info/invasive-species-profiles/red-whiskered-bulbul/).
    - "I followed it as it flitted between trees until it stopped to feed on a fruit I immediately recognised – guava, a plant native to Brazil," he says. "That moment captured the essence of what's happening in Hawaii: a South American plant being eaten by an Asian bird on a remote Pacific island."
    - Most of these exotic species arrived in the last century or two and were thrown together more or less at random – some are [escaped pets](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/hisc/info/invasive-species-profiles/jacksons-chameleon/), others [relics from abandoned farms](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/hisc/info/species/invasive-grasses-in-hawaii-and-their-impacts/). Yet unlike urban environments where foxes and seagulls scratch together a living eating anything they can find, the forests of O'ahu show signs of structure and organisation.

    - Birds that have only lived together for the last century have assumed specialist roles, such as distributing the seeds of native plants, that were once performed by now extinct birds. [In a 2019 study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau8751), Tarwater and Vizentin-Bugoni analysed the eating patterns of birds and seed dispersal on the island to see how they compared to a structured and stable native ecosystem that had evolved together over millennia.
    - "If I compare what I'm seeing in O'ahu with what I see in the middle of the Amazon, will the interactions have the same organisation?" asked Vizentin-Bugoni. "To our surprise, the answer was yes."
    - **Human-made ecosystems**
    - -------------------------
    - For the last few decades, ecologists have documented the appearance of "emerging" or "novel ecosystems" like that on O'ahu. Broadly, novel ecosystems can be defined as "autonomous, wild ecosystems that deviate from natural baselines because of human activities", explains ecologist Jens-Christian Svenning, a professor at Aarhus University in Denmark who studies these ecosystems. Novel ecosystems may contain combinations of species never before seen in history: with some native species living alongside other species introduced by humans beyond their historically recorded ranges or driven into new locations by climate change.
    - Humans may also alter the environment itself, creating new habitats by [reshaping the landscape](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x) or altering environmental chemistry. For example, along the coast of the Netherlands, marine ecologist Laura Govers has [documented how](https://www.rug.nl/fse/news/climate-and-nature/20250325-swimwaywaddenmozaiek?lang=en) a system of coastal defences like dams and sea walls, built during the mid-20th Century, has created a series of salty lakes where exotic species have flourished.
    - For the last decade scientists have studied O'ahu as an 'amazing crystal ball' that offers a glimpse of the future of our planet – Jef Vizentin-Bugoni
    - One former shale oil mine between the Scottish cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow left a mountain made of stone, says Eric Higgs, professor of ecology at the University of Victoria in Canada. Over at least a century piles of stone formed a novel ecosystem through natural assembly processes, says Higgs. It is now a specially protected area that [harbours rare plants](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277043838_West_Lothian_Biodiversity_Action_Plan_Oil_Shale_Bings) such as the early purple orchid and the tiny white flowers of the knotted pearlwort.
    - Unlike zoos and botanical gardens, which also contain globe-spanning collages of plants and animals, novel ecosystems like those on O'ahu are not dependent on humans to continually plant and maintain them. They now exist as self-sustaining systems, says Svenning. "These are wild but _changed_ ecosystems," he says. They have passed some critical threshold which means they are unlikely to ever go back to how they were before. "If you removed all people from the planet, Hawaii would be on a different evolutionary ecological trajectory going forward," he says.

    - Researchers studying O'ahu's unusual ecosystem during fieldwork on a site in Kahanahaiki (Credit: Jef Vizentin-Bugoni)
    - However, these figures – like much around "novel ecosystems" – remain highly controversial among ecologists. [Critics argue that](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534714001578) scientists often cannot clearly define when a threshold of novelty has been passed. There are plenty of cases that are "kind of borderline", says Svenning. For example, power plants in [Florida](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240328-floridas-manatees-are-hooked-on-power-plants) and [Japan](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0232065) are venting warm water that has created tropical microenvironments with an abundance and variety of species not seen in the surrounding cooler waters.
    - "They don't depend on direct active management," like zoos, Svenning says. "But they still rely on ongoing human activity to be there, right?"
    - **Hawaii's nature laboratory**
    - ------------------------------
    - For the last decade, says Vizentin-Bugoni, scientists have studied O'ahu as an "amazing crystal ball" that offers a glimpse of the future of our planet if humans continue to damage environments and drive species to extinction.
    - For millions of years, the remote location of the Hawaiian archipelago, some 2,000 miles (3,200km) from its nearest neighbour (the US mainland), made it a petri dish for the emergence of unique species. After the islands first emerged from the ocean as lifeless rocks [erupting from volcanoes between 30 million](https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/hvo/evolution-hawaiian-volcanoes) and [500,000 years ago](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10865/chapter/5#8), plants and animals arrived there extremely rarely. Migrating birds were the exception, along with the seeds they deposited in their droppings.
    - Hawaii's plants and the birds that remained there therefore evolved largely in isolation from the rest of the world, leading to the evolution of species found nowhere else on the planet, from "flightless ibises to bird-hunting owls", writes anthropologist Todd Braje in his 2024 book [Understanding Imperiled Earth](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/blogs/smithsonian-books/2024/03/07/the-disappearing-birds-of-hawaii/). Without any mammals or large predators of any kind, unique birds evolved to fill diverse niches, like the moa-nalo, (or "flightless megaducks", as Braje calls them) that grew to 2ft (0.6m) in height and helped to disperse large seeds and cycle nutrients on the islands.
    - We like to think of O'ahu as the cautionary tale for all the other Pacific Islands and the Hawaiian Islands. It's what you don't want to have happen – Corey Tarwater
    - Of the 142 species of bird that evolved to live on Hawaii and nowhere else on the planet, 95 are now extinct, including the moa-nalo, according to [the American Bird Conservancy](https://abcbirds.org/program/hawaii/). Similar trends among plants and invertebrates have earned it the label of the "[extinction capital of the world](https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2023/12/14/23990382/extinction-capital-hawaii-endangered-species-act)".
    - Hawaii's islands are a "microcosm" of the issues countries worldwide face from exotic species, according to [2020 research](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3309&context=icwdm_usdanwrc) led by Liba Pejchar, a conservation scientist at the University of Colorado. The arrival of humans – first small groups of Polynesian sailors around 1,000 years ago, later Europeans in 1778 – resulted in forest clearances and the introduction of rats, dogs and cows. For birds, the greatest threat today is the mosquito, which since the 1800s has spread avian malaria that can [kill native birds with a single bite](https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/climate-warms-hawaiian-forest-birds-lose-more-ground-mosquitoes).
    - "We like to think of O'ahu as the cautionary tale for all the other Pacific Islands and the Hawaiian Islands," says Tarwater. "It's what you don't want to have happen."

    - Unsurprisingly, when Tarwater began meticulously tagging Hawaiian birds, non-native species had a bad rap. "When we first started working out on O'ahu, we were asked by people why we didn't just shoot the \[non-native\] birds," says Tarwater. But by instead observing them, her and Vizentin-Bugoni's team discovered that several of the last native fruiting plants, such as the violet berried uki'uki which clings on in pockets high up the mountains, are wholly dependent on non-native birds to disperse seeds.
    - "It was shocking to us that they were just so embedded into these systems," says Tarwater. Still, it's a "double-edged sword", she says. "Unfortunately, they also disperse our non-native plants," she says – which can, in turn, crowd out the endangered natives.
    - During a decade investigating the rich networks that have self-assembled here, both Tarwater and Vizentin-Bugoni have been amazed to find the extent to which ecosystems have meshed together. In [a 2020 paper,](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2435.13670) Tarwater showed that the traits and bodies of non-native birds have shifted in areas they have invaded – some, for example, have smaller bills, better for eating O'ahu's smaller fruits. On O'ahu you can now watch mysterious flocks of numerous species take off together in search of fruit. This behaviour is also seen in the Amazon, but in O'ahu the flocks are made up of birds from all around the planet, from the Himalayas to South America.
    - **'Unrestorable' ecosystems**
    - -----------------------------
    - For the profoundly and irreversibly changed environments we see in O'ahu, the most intuitive name might have come not from a scientist at all but from Higgs' young daughter: she has dubbed them "freakosystems", he says. Since these strange places [began to gain recognition in the late 1990s](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oekom/gaia/2024/00000033/00000001/art00007;jsessionid=7jr5ndf4jpjp1.x-ic-live-02), the biggest question has been what environmentalists should do about them.
    - Invasive species
    - Deliberately and accidentally, humans have introduced countless species of animals, plants and other organisms to non-native biomes. While most new additions are innocuous, more than 37,000 species have been found to harm native species, habitats and ecosystems, causing them to be labelled invasive, according to the United Nations' [Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/five-drivers-nature-crisis) (IPBES).
    - Globally, invasive non-native species are one of the top five drivers of global biodiversity loss, according to IPBES, contributing to 60% of global extinctions and causing damages worth [$423bn (£323bn) per year](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/09/invasive-species-cost-global-economy-billions/).
    - Restoration ecologists have been on the frontlines of answering this question, says Higgs. Traditionally, these scientists have aimed to recover degraded landscapes towards some reference point – often, in the Americas, this was set about the time that European colonies began arising in the Americas. The idea was to restore ecosystems to a pre-disturbance or pre-human state.
    - But in many places – including islands like Hawaii and New Zealand, where so many species of plants and animals have gone extinct and non-native species have spread so far – turning back the clock was clearly impossible. This idea of "practical unrestorability" became the hallmark of what a novel ecosystem is, says Higgs.
    - Faced with these challenges, ecologists began to question how useful it would be to follow traditional conservation strategies, such as eradicating non-native "invasive" species – typically defined as an introduced species that harms its new environment. But it is not always easy, in much-changed environments, to identify which species these are.

    - A researcher removes a caught bird from mistnet on O'ahu (Credit: Jef Vizentin-Bugoni)
    - Take, for example, the packs of feral donkeys or "burros" that roam the American South and Australia, the descendants of working animals once used widely in mines and mills that were turned loose decades ago. In places where feral donkeys and horses have competed with native herbivores and overgrazed plants, some local governments have [resorted to large-scale culls](https://nt.gov.au/environment/animals/feral-animals/feral-donkey).
    - But research has shown that donkeys also dig water holes – known as wells or "ass holes" – in many cases providing the [only water source in drylands where temperatures can reach almost 50C](https://theconversation.com/feral-desert-donkeys-are-digging-wells-giving-water-to-parched-wildlife-159909) (122F). In the Sonoran Desert, which spans the US and Northern Mexico, these holes support more than 50 other species, including birds and large native mammals such as mule deer. Mountain lions have even been observed [eating donkeys](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2656.13766).
    - Yet for nature lovers brought up to value pristine environments, and having long ago learned of the destruction wrought by invasive [black rats](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989415000244) or [cane toads](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1657), novel ecosystems challenge many of the fundamental values that have [driven conservation for decades](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/110267). In 2011, when the writer Emma Marris published the influential book Rambunctious Garden, which explored novel ecosystems, critics [responded that she was giving permission to "trash nature"](https://ensia.com/voices/novel-ecosystems-are-a-trojan-horse-for-conservation/). Like Marris, many urban communities have come to love novel environments that have arisen in their local neighbourhoods. Mount Sutro, for example, a forest of non-native eucalyptus, has become [a much-loved park](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/sutro-forest_n_2729240) in San Francisco, says Higgs.
    - As climate change and nature-loss continue, ecologists are adapting their language to acknowledge that many ecosystems have "novel elements" or degrees of "ecological novelty". A new map [published by researchers in March 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-025-02662-2), tracked how ecosystems across the planet were being changed by climate change, the loss of key animals and native plants being replaced by invasive species. Matthew Kerr, a researcher in Svenning's lab at Aarhus University who made the map, says he found that novel habitats are now truly global, with more than half of the earth's land highly changed: "This extended out to protected areas," he says, including nature parks and marine reserves.
    - **Discovering what works**
    - --------------------------
    - O'ahu, at least, is teaching us important lessons that can help protect other environments not yet so degraded, including other islands where native ecosystems remain healthier, says Vizentin-Bugoni. Research has spotlighted certain species that set alarm bells ringing, as they are most likely to do harm to surrounding ecosystems.
    - ![](https://www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png)![Jef Vizentin-Bugoni Fruits can be collected on O'ahu which originate from all over the world (Credit: Jef Vizentin-Bugoni)](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l27q1q.jpg.webp)Jef Vizentin-Bugoni
    - Fruits can be collected on O'ahu which originate from all over the world (Credit: Jef Vizentin-Bugoni)
    - "For the plants, the ones that are most likely to be a problem are the ones that fruit for a long period and also have small seeds," he says. Both these characteristics increase the chance of being eaten by birds and spread around rapidly.
    - On O'ahu itself, research into novel ecosystems is guiding more unconventional conservation strategies. Most land managers are aiming to safeguard [the 87% of native plants threatened with extinction](https://iucn.org/news/species/201609/four-out-six-great-apes-one-step-away-extinction-%E2%80%93-iucn-red-list) by meticulously removing invasive plant species from "these tiny restoration sites", explains Tarwater. Although this allows native plants to grow without competition, these [denuded areas quickly become bird-free zones](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378112722002614#:~:text=The%20removal%20of%20non%2Dnative%20species%20is%20a%20critical%20conservation,et%20al.%2C%202002\).), she says. "There's not enough fruit in those areas to attract them there, which isn't good \[for native plants\], if those are the only things left to disperse their fruits."
    - To get the birds to spread native plants around, the team in O'ahu instead try to trick them. They [use speakers to play the calls](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eap.1963) of "birds that we know are really good seed dispersers" to lure them to restoration sites where native plants remained, Tarwater says. "Once they're there, they're like: 'Oh, hey, look at that fruit!' and they'll eat it." (Read about [how scientists coax back species with sound in other parts of the world too](https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20230519-the-sound-recordings-used-to-coax-back-species).)
    - Such strategies work with non-native birds to help conserve the tiny patches of remaining native plants – although many roles, such as the moa-nalos' dispersal of large seeds, are still not filled, as no non-native species are big enough.
    - It all makes unravelling what to do with these novel habitats difficult. "It's complex and depends on the goals of restoration," says Tarwater. A conservationist focusing on native plants may eradicate as many non-native competitors as possible, she says. "But if you're interested in conserving a native snail or some of these other species, that \[non-native plant\] might be the habitat that they currently rely upon."
    - While novel ecosystems remain controversial, on O'ahu, conservationists and land managers have become less black-and-white about native and non-native species, says Tarwater.
    - "We know that the challenges of the novel ecosystems are going to remain, and likely increase. We know that it's not as simple as them being good or bad."

    - Propaganda
    - # It’s Always the Other Side That’s Been Brainwashed | The New Yorker
    - It wasn’t so long ago that respectable psychologists didn’t really talk about “brainwashing.” The term had the slightly kitschy flavor of other Cold War embarrassments—[C.I.A.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/10/10/has-the-cia-done-more-harm-than-good) spy cats and [Reds-under-the-bed paranoia](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/03/17/red-scare-clay-risen-book-review). But Google’s indispensable Ngram Viewer, which analyzes how frequently phrases appear in printed texts, confirms that the past two decades have seen an uptick in the word’s usage. What’s bringing brainwashing back?
    - One potential answer is the rise of technologies suspected of having mind-controlling powers, chief among them [social media](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/we-know-less-about-social-media-than-we-think). Another is the entrenched political polarization of our time. When the cousin you kicked a soccer ball around with as a [child](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/03/03/the-population-implosion) starts spouting unhinged certainties about viruses, vaccines, and climate change—beliefs he treats as beyond debate—you might wonder: _What happened to him?_ This isn’t just an ordinary disagreement. Could he have been . . . brainwashed?
    - Don’t get smug; he’s wondering the same thing about you. A few years ago, _Psychology Today_ posted a checklist under the headline “Your Friend Might Be Politically Brainwashed If . . .” The last item on the list: “They assume that everyone who disagrees with them must be brainwashed.” So wait—does entertaining the possibility of having been brainwashed mean that you haven’t been? Or is that too easy?
    - Several recent books have taken up the subject of brainwashing—among them Daniel Pick’s “[Brainwashed: A New History of Thought Control](https://www.amazon.com/Brainwashed-History-Thought-Control-Wellcome-ebook/dp/B01MZC0D6I/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3PLMG0FMOG2V7&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6py3LW6K6yAoZgwThAD81kW3eKzxwtK74G2f7MHeR8jGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.HcQNUo5cx4Niem6ub3498PZYS0qM4rAYfpKdVGDmgG8&dib_tag=se&keywords=Brainwashed:%20A%20New%20History%20of%20Thought%20Control&qid=1743434256&s=audible&sprefix=,audible,115&sr=1-1)” (Profile), Joel E. Dimsdale’s “[Dark Persuasion: A History of Brainwashing from Pavlov to Social Media](https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Persuasion-History-Brainwashing-Pavlov/dp/0300247176/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.8DYoWnxNyjZJ_ft46UD4Nw.tMHEECgb3fY7b0N_L1uiXH-ll1_V2qGKSY_Zn2RZ9sI&qid=1743434154&sr=8-1)” (Yale), and Andreas Killen’s “[Nervous Systems: Brain Science in the Early Cold War](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-War-Brain-Andreas-Killen/dp/0062572652/ref=sr_1_1?crid=71APKIHRMFC3&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.17RJU0Pdvy_VS5TAhUYKJOjt9Rqe6dcclFlmSit6orY.znsMyEilt68_v7YCbKEj9Bg2eLXRtTa-2T7Fzu4p8po&dib_tag=se&keywords=nervous%20systems%20andreas%20killens&qid=1743434237&s=audible&sprefix=nervous%20systems%20andreas%20killens,audible,105&sr=1-1)” (HarperCollins). They share a scholarly squeamishness about the word they are forced to use for their subject matter. “Yes, the term _brainwashing_ is silly and unscientific,” Dimsdale writes. “No one ever meant it literally, but the metaphor is a powerful one.”
    - In the new book “[The Instability of Truth: Brainwashing, Mind Control, and Hyper-Persuasion](https://www.amazon.com/Instability-Truth-Brainwashing-Control-Hyper-Persuasion/dp/1324075260/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&dib_tag=se&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4yGIuMJ-iqj7AZpOgUzUMsxmpULDcdN6x5ShjbvCqiQ.nxZEogz3xrI7mqcjP1pJRIbRyO-t-KB5fPJFpvlCtd4&qid=1743434274&sr=1-1)” (Norton), Rebecca Lemov, a historian of science at Harvard, takes a different approach. She is often asked, she says, whether brainwashing really exists. “The answer is yes,” she writes, without any it-depends-what-you-mean-by hedging. In fact, she continues, “what we call brainwashing is not rare but common.”
    - Of course, words like “brainwashing” have no fixed meaning independent of their usage, which can be imprecise and expansive. When [Frantz Fanon](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/06/frantz-fanons-enduring-legacy) wrote of colonial efforts at _lavage de cerveau_ in Algeria, or when a commentator in the seventies accused President Richard Nixon of having “brainwashed” white workers into fearing Communist infiltration, the word was gesturing at _something_, however loosely defined.
    - Yet the term’s recent resurgence raises suspicions. Accusations of brainwashing aren’t neutral claims; they offer a particular explanation for why someone holds beliefs we find preposterous. That explanation attributes those beliefs to deliberate manipulation instead of rational argument or personal conviction. In doing so, it may recast those with “deplorable” beliefs as victims rather than agents, deserving of not just condemnation but sympathy—and, perhaps, treatment. In the seventies heyday of the cults, that treatment was called “deprogramming.” Is this what our addled cousins need? A systematic re-indoctrination into conventionality?
    - The earliest appearances of the concept “brainwashing,” Lemov writes, occurred in the mid-twentieth century, in the files of the Office of Strategic Services, a precursor of the C.I.A. The term came to prominence owing in large part to the writings of an American journalist named Edward Hunter. He claimed that it was a rendering of a Chinese phrase, but it may have been, as he elsewhere claimed, a coinage of his own to describe Chinese persuasion techniques.
    - These techniques were most famously applied during the Korean War. As a prisoner of war, Morris R. Wills faced a gamut of privations—he was left malnourished and consigned to filthy conditions amid the ever-present threat of execution. Horror alternated with boredom. Conditions improved when Wills was transferred to what was called Camp One. The food got better, letters could be sent home, and there were even volleyball games.
    - That was, it seems, an early stage of a procedure known as reëducation. Wills was identified as a member of the exploited classes, a promising target for the method. Reflecting on his experiences many years later, he said, “Brainwashing is not done with electrodes stuck to your head.” It was, rather, “a long, horrible process by which a man slowly—step by step, idea by idea—becomes totally convinced, as I was, that the [Chinese Communists](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/after-a-hundred-years-what-has-chinas-communist-party-learned) have unlocked the secret to man’s happiness and that the United States is run by rich bankers, McCarthy types, and ‘imperialist aggressors.’ ”
    - The theory behind this method, as articulated by Chairman Mao, didn’t sound so bad. People could not be forced to become Marxists, Mao wrote. He recommended, instead, “democratic” methods of “discussion, criticism, persuasion, and education.” An important stage of the process was called “speaking bitterness.” American G.I.s, like the Chinese peasants on whom the method had first been tried, had a great deal of bitterness to speak: of racism and poverty back home, and of discrimination within the armed forces. Wills was made to introspect, to write an autobiography. He and other P.O.W.s were subjected to hours of lectures on Marxist theory.
    - Faced with the demand to justify “the American system,” Wills—unable to articulate what that even was—found himself moving in what his captors called a Progressive (as opposed to Reactionary) direction. American society was rotting, he came to believe; the Chinese way was the future. He chose not to be repatriated. But, where other prisoners who made the same decision were sent to work on farms and in paper mills, he was sent to the People’s University in Beijing.
    - The brainwashing process was never complete. Ostentatious acts of “repentance” were repeatedly demanded—Wills had already had to participate in “self-criticism” seminars. He was now taught more about [Marxism](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/karl-marx-yesterday-and-today) and the history of China. He even witnessed a public execution. But he ended up staying in China for twelve years.
    - Wills’s retrospective accounts of his experience, once he was back in the United States and in a position to reflect on what had been done to him, are illuminating. It is plain that his Chinese captors had succeeded, at least for a time, in producing a genuine change of mind. He was, as he himself put it, “totally convinced.”
    - If we take Wills at his word, we might wonder about Mao’s claim that nobody can be coerced into sincere belief. In professing this, Mao echoes an old idea within modern European thought, one given its most influential expression in John Locke’s 1689 tract, “[A Letter Concerning Toleration](https://www.amazon.com/Letter-Concerning-Toleration-Hackett-Classics/dp/091514560X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1UCTBWDOOPRWD&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.5UknXXoxoSP3xxXGMb_yuSMm-CN6ng50c-XzTU-8XLxSMU9WASxKS2kVe7IstaWvrVRdtk462kdLagWDBuTYAmxY_r4uIZOVuD1j_QM4iuiMVuKWRAXs9lHIghjiO_4ZNtibk-DBHLKjo7EcG_310iQf5TFQpxoc4wBiXM9JJQQh-gfjulXbFzFRi3obUithtj4E9Gq8jH3wEzH23H1W9Gl-nK3bIev341Sniw4njTg.JSvvbVF8TRZJfm1wZdMj0FlFC62c7bjxxjRuspUmtL8&dib_tag=se&keywords=A%20Letter%20Concerning%20Toleration&qid=1743434467&s=books&sprefix=a%20letter%20concerning%20toleration,stripbooks,158&sr=1-1).” Locke condemned the use of coercion in matters of faith—the sort of thing we now associate with the Spanish Inquisitors—and among his arguments was that it simply _couldn’t_ work. Real belief is a product of the “inward persuasion of the mind,” he wrote. An effective torturer can make his victims move their limbs as he tells them to, or even say the words—professions of faith, confessions of guilt—that he whispers into their ears. But “such is the nature of the understanding, that it cannot be compelled to the belief of anything by outward force.”
    - Locke’s point is connected to a more general philosophical claim about belief: that no one can just _decide_ to believe something. Try believing, for instance, that the magazine (or computer or tablet or phone) in front of you is a venomous snake, or that your coffee mug is made of molten lava. You can cry out, if you like, but your steady heart rate will give you away.
    - For all that, you can surely be forced into situations where the desired conviction comes unbidden. Even in the seventeenth century, people saw the limitations of Locke’s view. An Oxford churchman named Jonas Proast agreed that belief could not be coerced directly, but, in his chilling words, the magistrate might lay “such Penalties upon those who refuse to embrace their Doctrine . . . as may make them _bethink_ themselves.”
    - To force someone to believe something requires the concealment of the role that force has played in the process. The brainwashed can’t conceive of themselves as brainwashed; to do so would indicate that the brain remains unwashed. They can only coherently describe their experience as one of seeing the light, having their consciousness raised, being red-pilled. As Lemov quotes someone telling her about brainwashing: if the method works, it “erases itself.”
    - So, if your environment was tailored to exclude alternative views, should we say that you were being forced to believe something? Whether we call this coerced belief is a matter of terminological preference. Ways of making people believe things don’t divide neatly into the persuasive and the coercive—the brainwashing model gives the lie to that distinction. As Lemov writes, echoing the psychologist Edgar Schein, it is “neither pure persuasion nor sheer coercion but both: coercive persuasion.”
    - The phrase “coercive persuasion” effectively conveys the core objection to what it describes. It suppresses the fundamental exercise of human autonomy—it prevents you from making up your own mind. If that’s the case, would the criminal courts find you responsible for what you do when you’ve been brainwashed?
    - This question was decisively answered during the trial of Patricia (Patty) Hearst, in 1976. Two years earlier, Hearst, a granddaughter of the press magnate William Randolph Hearst, was an undergraduate at Berkeley. Her life changed forever when she caught the eyes of members of the Symbionese Liberation Army, an anti-capitalist guerrilla group. They abducted her and held her in a closet, blindfolded, for nearly two months. She was raped multiple times by the group’s leaders while in captivity, having been told that it would be “uncomradely” to refuse consent.
    - Shortly afterward, she was offered a nominal choice. Would she join them? Or did she wish to be freed? It was clear to her that the appearance of choice was illusory, that she was choosing between joining the group and being killed. She chose life. Or, as she later put it, “I accommodated my thoughts to coincide with theirs.” As with the Korean War P.O.W.s before her, mere pretense was not, under the circumstances, a real option. “By the time they had finished with me,” she later reflected, “I was, in fact, a soldier in the Symbionese Liberation Army.”

    - A little more than two months after her abduction, surveillance cameras captured Hearst robbing a bank in San Francisco, gun in hand. When she was eventually arrested, she weighed eighty-seven pounds and was—in the assessment of the psychologist Margaret Singer—“a low-I.Q., low-affect zombie.” The Yale psychiatrist [Robert Jay Lifton](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/how-to-maintain-hope-in-an-age-of-catastrophe) interviewed Hearst for about fifteen hours and then declared her a “classic case” of brainwashing. During her time in custody, she repudiated her allegiance to the S.L.A. When she stood trial for her role in the bank robbery, her attorneys argued that she was a victim of coercion and duress.
    - It was a risky strategy. “I was brainwashed” was not a legally recognized defense. As Lemov, recounting the episode, points out, one of the psychiatrists who testified as an expert witness for the defense did Hearst no favors by admitting blithely that “brainwashing” was not a term of “any medical significance.” It had become, he said, “a sort of a grab bag to describe any kind of influence exerted by a captor over a captive, but that isn’t very accurate from the scientific or the medical point of view.”
    - The defense failed. Patty Hearst was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison. After she had completed nearly two, President Jimmy Carter commuted the sentence to “time served.” It was only on [Bill Clinton](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/09/18/the-wanderer-bill-clinton-profile-david-remnick)’s last day in office, in 2001, that she received a full pardon.
    - Why, Lemov asks, have lawyers found brainwashing “impossible to deploy as a legal exculpatory framework”? The concept evidently places defense lawyers in a double bind. If brainwashing doesn’t work, defendants can hardly claim it as a defense. But, if it does work, the defendants are acting on their own beliefs and no longer being coerced. An NPR interviewer forty years after the Hearst trial put the question in a revealing way: “Was she coerced, or did she become a believer?” Lemov rightly asks why it couldn’t be both. Why not say that “Hearst was coerced into becoming a true believer”?
    - The problem, as Lemov sees it, is that our intuitive model for thinking about brainwashing diagnoses it as a “rational, cognitive malfunction.” Hence the mockery to which the brainwashed are frequently subjected. The brainwashed soldiers of the Korean War were thought of as hapless dupes who “fell for” Communism, Lemov says. She invites us to consider a twenty-first-century parallel: the scorn directed at people who lose their savings to a [cryptocurrency](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/cryptocurrency) cult.
    - Lemov thinks that this perception shifts once we acknowledge the role of trauma in brainwashing. Maybe so. But how does this claim square with her broader hypothesis that “what we call brainwashing is not rare but common”? If trauma is a necessary condition for brainwashing, as she suggests, it follows that trauma is more widespread than we might assume. Yet she insists that she is not among the credulous sentimentalists who “see trauma everywhere.” How common, then, is brainwashing?
    - For recent historians of brainwashing, the issue carries high contemporary stakes. Joel Dimsdale, in “Dark Persuasion,” relates the disturbing case of Alexander Urtula, who took his life after receiving a staggering forty-seven thousand text messages from his girlfriend, who kept urging him to do so. Dimsdale asks, “If you can use social media to persuade an individual you know well to do something awful, can you persuade a wider circle of friends and acquaintances?” Given the resources—for instance, “troll farms” of the kind that state actors can muster—it appears that you sometimes can.
    - The power of such trolls lies in their ability to manipulate the epistemic environment. What was once a lone voice ranting at a street corner becomes a mutually reinforcing chorus. “When observers receive the same message from multiple sources,” Dimsdale writes, “they find the messages more believable, even if they are preposterous.” When President Trump tells us that “a lot of people are saying . . . ,” this claim, at least, is true.
    - There was outrage when it was revealed that [Facebook](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/19/why-facebook-cant-fix-itself) researchers were tinkering with users’ emotions—making tiny tweaks to their feeds in what Lemov calls “massive-scale emotional engineering.” But she notes that the backlash didn’t stop the researchers from running these experiments; it just made them more reticent about their results. One researcher on the project said that the response amounted to people thinking, “You can’t mess with my emotions. It’s like messing with me. It’s mind control.”
    - And, in a sense, it _is_ mind control. But that phrase, much like “brainwashing,” runs into a tricky question: Isn’t everything that shapes our thoughts, desires, or feelings a form of mind control? Lurking behind our unease is a fantasy of total, unshackled cognitive freedom. Any deviation from that ideal gets labelled as manipulation. If we cling to that standard, then, sure, we’re all brainwashed. But the standard is an absurdity. It’s obvious that our minds are shaped by the world we live in, including what others say. This isn’t what we have in mind when we talk about mind control.
    - Our idea, instead, is that to be free is not to be subject to the will of another. Lemov quotes an impassioned remark made by the Princeton sociologist [Zeynep Tufekci](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/innovation-dial-up-on-the-bosphorus) about how online corporate power enlists “new tools and stealth methods to quietly model our personality, our vulnerabilities, identify our networks, and effectively nudge and shape our ideas, desires and dreams.” That’s the real worry these days—not just influence but control that’s hidden and personal.
    - Lemov’s emphasis on trauma suggests that the concept of brainwashing may not be all that helpful in understanding whatever it is that social media does to its users. Morris Wills was starved and terrified as a P.O.W. Patty Hearst was locked in a closet and sexually assaulted. Contemporary sociology invites us, perhaps rightly, to extend the traditional concept to include the working-class experience of deindustrialization and the precarity of the white-collar knowledge worker denied a secure job. The question still arises: What has your average [TikTok](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-happened-when-an-extremely-offline-person-tried-tiktok) user been subjected to that is remotely comparable to what Wills and Hearst endured?
    - There’s another irony here. Much of what Wills came to believe when he lived in China—that socialism is superior to capitalism, that the United States is an imperialist power run by a class of kleptocratic oligarchs—is shared by many young people today who were subjected to nothing more traumatic than a typical liberal-arts education. Their professors would, of course, balk at the implication that they’ve brainwashed their students, but that’s exactly what their critics in the conservative media have long been accusing them of.
    - It’s a familiar pattern in our polarized age. The right accuses the left of using the institutions it dominates—the federal bureaucracy, nonprofits, universities, Hollywood, and “legacy” media—to brainwash the public. The left, in turn, levels the same charge against the right, pointing to talk radio, partisan television networks, and manosphere podcasts. (Each side condemns the other’s social-media activity.) Naturally, no one admits to doing what they denounce in their opponents. But that’s to be expected: persuasion is what we do; brainwashing is what they do.
    - Does the case of the radical professor fit into this model of malign manipulation? Come to think of it, what exactly should we make of the Communists who brainwashed the American soldiers? Or the members of the Symbionese Liberation Army—mainly white, middle-class, and well educated—who appeared quite sincerely to believe their rhetoric calling for “death to the fascist insect that preys upon the life of the people”? Were _they_ brainwashed into their beliefs, too? Or did they form them in the way that we all do—as the result of some half-conscious process only half mindful of evidence and truth?
    - We can grant that the term “brainwashing” has some utility as an explanation for what happened to certain individuals who were subjected to extraordinary stress and strenuous efforts at reëducation. But we needn’t reach for it when we seek to describe, and understand, the masses of people who fail to see what we find clear-cut. There are simply too many other ways of making sense of their beliefs.
    - Heterodox views—particularly antinomian ones—are attractive in part because they are at odds with the obvious. If our beliefs were obvious, how could we use them to distinguish our group from others? How could our beliefs be used to demarcate a social identity? Even in more mainstream precincts, plenty of our avowed beliefs—“our diversity is our strength”—may not be real beliefs at all, if belief is something that holds itself accountable to fact. In ways the philosopher Daniel Williams has explored, they are better understood as shibboleths, tribal anthems, expressions of commitment so deep that we cannot conceive of doubting them. Insofar as these clichés don’t express factual propositions, we shouldn’t apply to them the explanatory frameworks designed to tell us how people come to credit outlandish things.
    - We may be better served by looking to more conventional human motivations: our desire for approval from those around us, and the way social incentives can reward the outrageous and punish the reasonable. Social media strengthens these tendencies by indulging them and allowing them to operate on an unprecedented scope. Ordinary forces working on a vast scale often produce the effect of an extraordinary force.
    - Although beliefs can be badges—tribal markers chosen less for their empirical accuracy than for what they signal about us—plenty of people do buy into outlandish factual views. It’s not a cope, or a flex; it’s what they take to be reality. How about them?
    - There’s a well-meaning, if patronizing, ethical impulse behind our propensity to blame brainwashing for others’ convictions, whether they’re expressions of allegiance, hard factual commitments, or something in between. Labelling people as brainwashed casts them as one of the damned—lost souls whom we, as saviors, must redeem. Yet it might be our own savior complexes that we need to shed.
    - The philosopher [Karl Popper](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/04/01/the-porcupine), writing in 1960, suggested that the temptation to attribute misguided beliefs to sinister manipulation came from a mistaken assumption: that “truth is manifest.” If the truth were manifest, it would follow that the failure to grasp it must reflect “the work of powers conspiring to keep us in ignorance, to poison our minds by filling them with falsehood.”
    - But, even when confronted with a world of people holding views we find baffling, why assume that they’re victims of a grand conspiracy—or victims at all? Perhaps truth isn’t so obvious. Uncovering it demands effort and a bit of luck. Other people will take different things to be true because their paths—owing to differences in diligence or chance—diverged from ours. That conspiracy-minded cousin isn’t necessarily a casualty of mind control; he may simply have wandered down intellectual rabbit holes where evidence matters less than belonging. To depict him as a victim of manipulation grants him an unearned absolution. The most disturbing possibility isn’t that millions have been brainwashed. It’s that they haven’t. ♦

    - As I think about embracing authenticity and imperfection—both in life and in art—the metaphor I keep coming back to is kintsugi, which translates to “golden joinery.” Kintsugi is the centuries-old Japanese art of mending broken ceramics with gold. You’ve probably seen examples, either up close or in photos: ceramic bowls repaired with gold; depending on where the breaks occurred, they almost look veined with it.
    - The artist doesn’t hide the cracks, but fills them with lacquer dusted with powdered gold, silver, or platinum, so that it gleams where it was pieced back together. The artist honors the object’s history—what it went through to become what it is now, including being broken. And the artist gives the object new life.
    - So what does it mean to honor the history of a piece of writing? If you’re like me, your poem or essay might go through anywhere from two to two hundred drafts before you’re satisfied enough with it to call it “done” and send it out. Each revision, ideally, gets us closer to the piece we sense is there, waiting. The piece that will do the psychic or spiritual work we want it to do. But each revision can also pull us farther away from the initial spark that drove us to the page. This tension, this push and pull, is what makes revision dynamic and exciting: we’re hunting something but aren’t quite clear about what it looks like or how to find it.
    - When I think about accepting the gift our poems give us in the guise of error, I think of the advice that we Midwesterners know all too well about driving in ice and snow: Steer into the skid, not out of it.
    - We can honor the object’s history by allowing the process to show. In this way, the break isn’t something that happened after the piece was finished—after the bowl was formed and fired and glazed. The breaking is part of the writing process, part of the story of the object being made. Maybe the piece of writing wasn’t finished, not fully itself, until the break.
    - Article continues after advertisement
    - We often say, “make it or break it.” I’m on the side of “make it and break it.” Or make it by letting it break and seeing what might come of it.
    - Perhaps kintsugi in writing is when the writer makes a mistake but decides to keep it, and in fact calls attention to it, leaning into the mistakes—mishearings, misreadings, misunderstandings, even typos—and filling the breaks with gold. The error—if we may call it an error—leads to new insights, layers of meaning, or exciting associative leaps that make the poem more of itself, not less than. The mistake, in fact, is a gift. The break, or breakdown, allows for a breakthrough.
    - “Written Deer” from _Goldenrod_ is one example. I was reading poems by Wisława Szymborska when I came across this line: “Why does this written doe bound through these written woods?” The question made me want to push further into the setting—the written woods—and to consider what it means to both create and experience (or write and read) a place. I draft all of my poems longhand, often writing very quickly, and in my messy half-print, half-cursive handwriting, world and word were almost indistinguishable. As the poem came into focus, this conflation made its way into the poem’s argument. I could have left this error out of the poem, but it led me to consider what these two things have in common: “Either one could be erased.” That stark realization felt important to me, so it’s in the poem.

    - each loop a limb. My house is somewhere
    - here, & I have scribbled myself inside it.
    - What is home but a book we write, then
    - read again & again, each time dog-earing
    - different pages. In the morning I wake
    - in time to pencil the sun high. How
    - fragile it is, the world—I almost wrote

    - _the word_ but caught myself. Either one
    - could be erased. In these written woods,
    - branches smudge around me whenever
    - I take a deep breath. Still, written fawns
    - lie in the written sunlight that dapples
    - their backs. What is home but a passage
    - I’m writing & underlining every time I read it.
    - Sometimes miswriting or mistyping a word can lead to a new insight that wasn’t accessible before. What may seem like a mistake may in fact be the most important point in the poem, the place where the poet discovers new territory. Or the part where the poem introduces the poet to its subject.
    - “How Killer Blue Irises Spread” by Kelli Russell Agodon was inspired by a misheard health report on NPR. The story behind the poem is this: A poet, also the mother of a young girl at the time, was listening to NPR and misheard the title of an upcoming segment. She thought she heard the announcer say “How Killer Blue Irises Spread” and panicked, worrying because there were blue irises growing in their garden, where her daughter played. The NPR segment was actually “How Killer Flu Viruses Spread”—but Agodon leaned into the misunderstanding and tried to imagine all the ways that blue irises could be dangerous or actual killers, and we see these imaginative leaps in the poem. This sense of play—the pleasure the poet had writing this piece—would not have been possible without the error.
    - Article continues after advertisement
    - When I think about accepting the gift our poems give us in the guise of error, I think of the advice that we Midwesterners know all too well about driving in ice and snow: Steer into the skid, not out of it. To keep from losing control you have to turn in the direction you’re sliding, even though you desperately want to wrench yourself in the opposite direction. In this poem, Agodon steers into the skid.
    - A poem is not only a temporal experience but a human experience—and we are imperfect. By allowing imperfection into our poems—by letting some of the breaks and repairs show—we are also allowing our humanity into our poems, and allowing for a different kind of intimacy between the reader and writer. Dylan Thomas wrote, “The best craftsmanship always leaves holes and gaps in the works of the poem so that something that is not in the poem can creep, crawl, flash, or thunder in.”
    - I read poems and essays to witness someone else’s mind at work, and these moments of error or brokenness, these switchbacks, help me see that work. In a sense, the gold that “fixes” the breaks in our work is the very material it is made of: language. And in Thomas’s words, the breaks are openings.
    - Allowing ourselves to falter, to be disoriented, to find a new foothold—that strengthens us, too. And of course all of this applies to living as much as it does to writing. We’re going to make mistakes. Instead of trying to hide the breaks, or revise a piece to “correct” the error and make it impossible to detect, we have another option, as these poems show us.
    - I hope you’ll let some of the seams show in your next piece of writing. I hope you’ll let some of the history remain. Challenge yourself not to buff out every scratch and sand down every splinter. Accept the gifts that arrive packaged as missteps. Acknowledge the breaks and let them shine.

  - A crackdown on political dissent is well under way in Germany. Over the past two years, institutions and authorities have cancelled events, exhibitions and awards over statements about Palestine or Israel. There are many examples: the Frankfurt book fair [indefinitely postponing]([https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/09/palestinian-author-adania-shibli-frankfurt-book-fair](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/09/palestinian-author-adania-shibli-frankfurt-book-fair)) an award ceremony for Adania Shibli; the Heinrich Böll Foundation [withdrawing the Hannah Arendt prize]([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/14/award-ceremony-suspended-after-writer-masha-gessen-compares-gaza-to-nazi-era-jewish-ghettos](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/14/award-ceremony-suspended-after-writer-masha-gessen-compares-gaza-to-nazi-era-jewish-ghettos)) from Masha Gessen; the University of Cologne [rescinding a professorship]([https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/apr/10/nancy-fraser-cologne-university-germany-job-offer-palestine](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/apr/10/nancy-fraser-cologne-university-germany-job-offer-palestine)) for Nancy Fraser; the No Other Land directors Basel Adra and Yuval Abraham [being defamed]([https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/27/israeli-director-receives-death-threats-after-officials-call-berlinale-antisemitic](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/27/israeli-director-receives-death-threats-after-officials-call-berlinale-antisemitic)) by German ministers. And, most recently, the philosopher Omri Boehm [being disinvited]([https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/philosoph-omri-boehm-darf-bei-buchenwald-gedenkfeier-nicht-sprechen-a-b764ce35-cfee-488c-a7b2-e478d23c3f21](https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/philosoph-omri-boehm-darf-bei-buchenwald-gedenkfeier-nicht-sprechen-a-b764ce35-cfee-488c-a7b2-e478d23c3f21)) from speaking at this month’s anniversary of the liberation of Buchenwald.

    - Research on the underground railroad, the network of activists helping enslaved people escape to the northern states in America or Canada, has shown that influential church leaders [played a crucial role](https://www.amazon.com/Bound-Canaan-Underground-Railroad-America/dp/0060524308). They refused to follow federal legislation that obliged them to help slave owners capture enslaved people that had escaped.
    - Teaching others about morally courageous figures can work, but heroism is not the key for all learners. The science suggests a number of other – perhaps surprising – objectives which can move ordinary people to stand up for democracy. In particular, educational initiatives [that boost contact between different groups](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-35832-004) may be useful.

    - This presumption of canniness is fallacious even when applied to highly competent politicians, who are coherent perhaps 70 percent of the time. So you can imagine how wide of the mark it falls with Trump, who—impaired already by malignant narcissism and functional illiteracy—demonstrates on a near-daily basis growing signs of cognitive decline (the latest example being his petulant response last weekend to whether the tariffs would raise auto prices: “I couldn’t care less”). If Trump were your elderly grandpa, you’d have taken the car keys from him months ago and would be starting to investigate assisted living.

    - "Actual reform – rather than wanton destruction – is all the more urgent now that we’ve seen what happens when the state fails to effect positive change. “Look, the fact that the Biden administration was not able, despite passing all this historic legislation, to deliver government improvements on a timeline people could feel, and that that helped open the door to the return of Donald Trump, who is now running a hack and slash operation to destroy government under the guise of efficiency – that is exactly why it is really important liberals make government work."

    - *Analysis* - We now have a clearer picture of Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs and how they will [affect other trading nations](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/02/trump-hits-uk-with-10-tariffs-as-he-ignites-global-trade-war), including the United States itself.
    - The US administration claims these tariffs on imports will reduce the US trade deficit and address what it views as unfair and non-reciprocal trade practices. Trump said this would "forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed".
    - The "reciprocal" tariffs are designed to impose charges on other countries equivalent to half the costs they supposedly inflict on US exporters through tariffs, currency manipulation and non-tariff barriers levied on US goods.
    - Each nation received a tariff number that will apply to most goods. Notable sectors exempt include steel, aluminium and motor vehicles, which are already subject to new tariffs.
